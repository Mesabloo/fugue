# `linter.fugue.selectorTry`

`all: try tac` — and every other selector over a bare `try` (`1-3: try tac`,
`all_goals try tac`) — runs `tac` under `try`, so a goal where `tac` fails is silently left
untouched and the proof no longer records which goals the selector closed. Name the goals the
tactic applies to (`1,3: tac`), or drop the `try` and the selector both if it closes them all.
