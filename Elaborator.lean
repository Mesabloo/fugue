  Ties the whole checker together: `CoreTLAPlus.Module.check`, threading `Γ` across
  `declarations₁` → the embedded PlusCal algorithm → `declarations₂`, and `Module.runChecker`,
  the one concrete monad instantiation this pass is ever run at.

  The embedded algorithm is checked but does *not* extend `Γ` any further — PlusCal-internal
  declarations (`variables`/`channels`/`fifos`) don't leak into the surrounding TLA⁺ module's own
  `Γ`. `declarations₂` is checked against the same `Γ` that `declarations₁` left behind, exactly
  as if the algorithm weren't there at all.

/-- `Γ ⊢ M typeok`: `declarations₁`, then the embedded algorithm (if any), then `declarations₂`
against the same `Γ` `declarations₁` left behind. `Δ` (`RECURSIVE`-pending operators) threads
across both declaration lists — a `RECURSIVE` predeclaration in `declarations₁` may be discharged
as late as `declarations₂` (`recursive-operators-plan.md`'s B.1, "anywhere later in the module") —
but not through the embedded algorithm, which never reads or extends `Δ`. Whatever's still
undischarged once both lists are checked is an error: a `RECURSIVE` operator with no matching
definition anywhere in the module. -/

/-- Run the checker against its one concrete monad instantiation: `Γ`'s `ReaderT`, the
metavariable/pending-bounds contexts as nested `StateT`s, and `MonadDiagnostic`'s `TCError`/
`TCWarning` reporting via `DiagT`, so a warning emitted before a later fatal error still
survives. No checking rule emits a `TCWarning` yet, but the capability is wired through
uniformly with every other pass. `Γ₀` is the caller-supplied initial context. The base monad `n`
stays abstract, constrained only to supply the fresh-name counter (`MonadStateOf Nat`, which
`Common/Fresh.lean`'s `MonadFresh` instance reads, needed here by `Subtyping.lean`): the counter
belongs to one compile, owned by `Driver/Modules.lean`'s `DriverState`, not to the process. -/
