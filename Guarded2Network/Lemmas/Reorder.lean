  Commuting an assignment past a guard.

  `processPrecondition` compiles a `receive` into an `await` on the inbox plus two consumption
  assignments, and those assignments are *not* emitted where the `receive` was: they are prepended to
  the branch's action block, so they end up after every guard the precondition still has to run
  (`stepBranch`). What keeps that sound is that each guard is rewritten on the way past —
  `substGuards` substitutes every already-processed assignment's effect into it. This file says
  those two moves cancel.

  The guard constructor is not split on: `with` and `await` differ only in which field carries the
  guard expression. The split that remains is the real one — reducing and aborting are different
  statements, and only the first is an equation.

/-! ## Freshness

  Only the `with` case has a side condition, and only one: the name it binds. The bound name is
  written into the memory the assignment also writes, so unless the two names are distinct the writes
  do not commute; and it is in scope for the assignment's own right-hand side on one side of the
  equation but not the other. `await` binds nothing and needs neither.
-/

/-- What a guard statement must avoid for an assignment to commute past it. Phrased as an
implication from `S`'s shape rather than by cases on `S`, so a caller that does not know which
constructor it has can still discharge it — the same shape `Guarded2Network/Lemmas/Statement.lean`'s
`Fresh` uses for the mailbox. -/

/-- Substitution leaves a guard's freshness alone: `substGuardStmt` rewrites the guard *expression*
and nothing else, so the bound name a `with` carries — the only thing `GuardFresh` looks at — comes

/-- **Reducing.** An assignment commutes with a following guard, provided the guard's
substituted form is what runs on the other side. An equation, not an inclusion: every run of one side
is a run of the other, with the same trace — both sides take two silent steps.

The `with` case is where `Memory` being a `Finmap` is load-bearing. The two sides bind the same two
names to the same two values in opposite orders, so the memories they reach are equal only once
insertion order stops being observable (`ComputableTLAPlus.Memory`). -/

/-- **Aborting.** The same commutation for the runs that fail — and here only an inclusion. Every
way the compiled order `guard[subst] ; assign` can abort is a way the source order `assign ; guard`
can, but not conversely: a guard has a third outcome an assignment does not, since it can *block*. A
state where the assignment aborts and the substituted guard blocks is a source abort and not a target
one, so the two sets are not equal.

Each union member is handled once. A target abort *in the guard* becomes a source assignment step
followed by the same abort, or an abort of that assignment (`assign_aborts_or_steps` — there is no
third case). A target abort *in the assignment* becomes an immediate source abort, the guard having
no way to change whether the assignment fails. -/

/-- **The whole accumulator past one source-written guard, for the runs that fail.**
`reorder_assigns_guard'`'s aborting twin, and an inclusion for the same reason the one-assignment
case is: the compiled order can only abort where the source order can.

The induction is `reorder_assigns_guard'`'s, with `Relation.lcomp₁.commute_step` in place of the
`rw` chain — the algebra of moving an abort set past a composition is the same at every step, and
saying it once is what keeps the two orderings' bookkeeping out of this proof. -/
