/-!
  Statement-level refinement: what `Guarded2Network` does to a single action statement, and the two
  transfer lemmas every later proof leans on.

  **Evaluation transfer.** The pass introduces exactly one name, `inbox`, and it is fresh
  (`freshName`'s `$` separator makes collision with a source name impossible). So any source
  expression evaluates the same in the target's memory, which differs only at `inbox`: that is
  `relatesTo.eval_iff`.

  **Reference arguments.** A reference's index path is evaluated by a `List.Forall₂` over
  `EvalStep`. Naming that relation — `Ref.EvalArgs` — and giving it its own congruence lemma keeps
  the `Forall₂` nesting out of every use site.

/-! ## Transferring a memory update

  `assign` (and, on the source side, `receive`) writes through `Memory.update`. Simulating that step
  means running the same update in the other memory and finding the results still related — which
  holds because the two memories agree at the written name, so they read the same old value, compute
  the same new one, and insert it.
-/

/-- An update that succeeds in one memory succeeds in any memory agreeing with it *at the written
name* — both read the same old value and compute the same new one — and the results then agree
there too. Everywhere else the two results agree exactly where the originals did, which is
`Memory.lookup_update_ne` and needs no hypothesis at all. -/

/-- An update touches only the name it writes. What keeps the refinement invariant's *other*

`assign` to some third variable. -/

(`relatesTo.label_congr` and `.fifo_push` are the other two, in `Guarded2Network/Lemmas/
Relation.lean`; this one lives here because it needs `Ref.EvalArgs.congr_of_fresh`).

Both sides write the same name to the same value, which is what `assign` and `with` each do. The
name must be neither the generated `inbox` — else the target's mailbox contents would move — nor one
the mailbox channel is indexed by — else the key the invariant pins would move out from under it.
Both conditions arrive from `Fresh` already in the guarded shape, so no use site case-splits on
`mbox`. -/

/-! ## Action statements

  `convertActionStmt` maps each of the seven action constructors to its namesake in the target
  language, and the two `Statement.reducing` definitions agree character-for-character on those
  cases (the only differences in the whole `def` are the type name, one comment, and Guarded's extra
  `receive` case). So the semantics is not merely preserved but *definitionally equal*, and one
  `cases … <;> rfl` proves each semantic component.
-/

/-- The one name a statement writes, if any. Needed by `Fresh` below: the refinement invariant pins
*one* resolved channel key, so a statement that overwrote a variable the mailbox channel is indexed
by would move that key out from under it. -/
def Statement.writtenName? {b b' : Bool} :
    ComputableGuardedPlusCal.Statement b b' → Option String
  | .assign r _ => .some r.name
  | .receive _ r _ => .some r.name
  | .with x _ _ _ => .some x
  | _ => .none

/-- What a statement must avoid for the pass's `inbox` not to disturb it: it cannot read `inbox`,
`inbox` cannot be `self` — `print`/`send` read `self` to tag the event they emit, which is a name the
*semantics* reads on its own and so is invisible to a freshness condition stated over the statement's
free variables — it cannot write a name the mailbox channel is indexed by, and it cannot *bind*
`inbox`. All hold of any real compilation: `freshName`'s `$` separator puts `inbox` outside the
source program's namespace entirely.

Stated for every guard class, not just the action one: the last clause exists only for `with`, which
is guard-class, and the block-level refinement needs the same predicate on both halves of a
branch. -/
def Fresh (mbox : Mailbox) {g b : Bool} (S : ComputableGuardedPlusCal.Statement g b) : Prop :=
  ∀ c inbox, mbox = .some (c, inbox) →
    inbox ∉ GuardedPlusCal.Statement.freeVars S ∧ inbox ≠ GuardedPlusCal.selfName ∧
      (∀ x, Statement.writtenName? S = .some x → x ∉ GuardedPlusCal.Ref.freeVars c) ∧
      ∀ x, GuardedPlusCal.Statement.boundName? S = .some x → x ≠ inbox

/-- `assign` and `send` each read one reference and one expression, and `Statement.freeVars` is the
union of the two halves' free variables. Every branch of the two simulation lemmas below splits
`Fresh`'s first component this way, so the split is named once here. -/
theorem fresh_split {x : String} {r : ComputableGuardedPlusCal.Ref} {e : ComputablePlusCal.Expression}
    (h : x ∉ GuardedPlusCal.Ref.freeVars r ∪ Expression.freeVars e) :
    x ∉ GuardedPlusCal.Ref.freeVars r ∧ Expression.FreshIn x e :=
  ⟨λ hr ↦ h (Finset.mem_union_left _ hr), λ he ↦ h (Finset.mem_union_right _ he)⟩

/-- The workhorse behind `action_refines`: an action statement's semantics is closed under
`relatesTo`. Given a target step out of `σₜ` and a source state related to it, the source takes the
*same* step — same trace, results still related.

Phrased on one language's semantics because `convertActionStmt_reducing'` already says the target's
semantics *is* the source's; `action_refines` below is what states the result in the framework's own
terms. Each piece built above is spent here: `eval_iff'` for the statements that evaluate an
expression, `relatesTo.evalArgs_iff` for those that resolve a reference, `Memory.update_transfer`
and `relatesTo.mem_congr` for `assign`, `relatesTo.fifo_push` for `send`, and
`relatesTo.label_congr` for the four that do none of those.

Nothing here splits on `mbox`. Every hypothesis `Fresh` supplies is already guarded by
`mbox = .some (c, inbox)`, and every fact taken off `sim` — `mem_agree'`, `eval_iff'`,
`evalArgs_iff`, `fifo_split` and the transport lemmas — holds in both cases. -/

/-! ## The guard class

  `Statement.reducing_sim` covers the action constructors. The two guard constructors the pass
  copies across — `with` and `await` — need the same fact, and get their own lemma rather than a
  generalization of that one: the *third* guard constructor is `receive`, which emphatically does
  not preserve `relatesTo`, and a statement quantified over the class would have to carve it out by
  hand at every use.
-/

/-- `Statement.reducing_sim` for the guard class. `await` reads an expression and changes nothing;
`with` additionally binds a name, and the binding is invisible to the invariant exactly because
`Fresh` says the bound name is neither `inbox` nor read by the mailbox channel's index path. -/

/-! ## The guard-class statements the two languages share

  `with` and `await` exist in both languages with the same fields and the same meaning. There is no
  conversion function to state this against — one cannot exist, `receive` having no image — and
  `stepStatement` writes the target constructor out directly. So what the refinement needs is not
  that a conversion preserves semantics but that the two constructors *denote the same relation*,
  which they do on the nose.

  Six `rfl`s rather than one lemma over a conversion, and that is the honest shape: the fact is
  per-constructor, and the class of statements it covers is not the image of any function.
