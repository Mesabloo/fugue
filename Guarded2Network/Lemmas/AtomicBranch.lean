  One atomic branch, compiled.

  `stepBranch` (`Guarded2Network/PlusCal.lean`) does two things to a branch: it walks the
  precondition with `processPrecondition`, and it converts the action block statement by statement
  with `convertActionStmt` — prepending the consumption assignments the walk hoisted out to the
  *action* block rather than leaving them where the `receive`s were.

  So this file is two lemmas and their composition. `actionBlock_refines` lifts
  `Lemmas/Statement.lean`'s per-statement `action_refines` over a whole block, which is one
  `StrongRefinement.Comp` per statement and nothing more — the action language is unchanged by this
  pass, so no reordering is involved. `Lemmas/Precondition.lean`'s `processPrecondition_spec` covers
  the other half. Composing them is where the assignments move from the precondition's right edge
  (where the precondition triple leaves them) to the action block's left edge (where the pass
  actually puts them), which is one associativity step.

  Freshness stays a hypothesis here, as it does at every level of this proof: these are syntactic
  conditions on the source program and on the pass's generated `inbox`, and discharging them needs
  the passes before this one (type checking, well-formedness).

Nothing is reordered and nothing is generated: `convertActionStmt` is a relabelling of the same
statement into the target language, so this is the plain structural lift. All the work of this pass
is in the precondition, which is why that half needed a whole file and this one is an induction.

/-- Every thread of a list is a receive loop on this process's channel and `inbox`, under a label the
pass generated. Stated on the bare list rather than on `ThreadState` because `Thread.toNetwork` hands
the accumulator's `rxThreads` back as a plain list, and the levels above it never see the state
again.

All three extra conjuncts ride along for the same reason the rest does: `stepBranch` is the only
place a receiving thread is ever appended, so it is the only place any of them can be established.
The process level is what spends them. `Generated` keeps a receiving thread's label out of the
source's, or a code thread could be scheduled at it. `c₀` makes the mailbox the algorithm level
assigns the process name the same channel its receiving thread drains — a process has only one
channel (`BranchesFresh.rfresh`), so there is only one to name. `mbox = .some (c₀, inbox)` rules out
the other mailbox: a thread is registered only for a branch that receives, and a branch that receives
is what `BranchesFresh.mbox_some` says has a mailbox at all. And the channel does not mention the
generated name, which is `ReceiveFresh`'s first clause and what `ProcessRefines.rxThread` reports it
for — a relay resolves its channel in a memory the relay itself is about to write `inbox` in.
`algRelatesTo.stuttering`/`.immediateAbort` read it off `rxThread` at the resolved instance. -/

/-- **One entry of the locals list the pass invents**: the `inbox`, declared as a sequence and

/-- What the pass has put in its accumulator: every thread in `rxThreads` is an `.rx` on this call's
channel and `inbox`, every entry in `newLocals` is that `inbox`'s declaration, and the two lists are
empty together.

`stepBranch` is the only place either list is ever appended to, so this is where all three have to be
established. The thread level is where the first is needed — `Thread.toNetwork` hands `rxThreads`
back as threads, and what makes that sound is that each is a receive loop rather than arbitrary code.
The other two are `Algorithm.init`'s: a process that receives is compiled with an `inbox` to receive
into, and one that does not is compiled with no extra local at all, so its memory is the source's.

The third is what ties them, and it needs no ghost: `stepBranch` appends to both lists or to neither,
so "empty together" is an invariant of the state rather than a fact about the walk so far. -/

/-- **A branch that receives at all** — what makes the pass register a receiving thread, and so what
the registration fact is conditioned on.

Existential where `BranchesFresh`'s fields are universal, and the difference is not cosmetic: those
are hypotheses, discharged once per `receive` a branch has, while this is what a *conclusion* is
conditioned on, and one `receive` is all it takes. -/

/-- **The registration fact, in the form that survives a walk.** `H` is whatever the caller already
knows has registered a thread — everything walked before this call — and each level hands back
`Registered (H ∨ ‹this step receives›)`, so the fact accumulates along the walk instead of being
re-established at each step.

The parameter is what makes that possible at all. A Hoare postcondition cannot mention the pre-state,
so "and the list was already non-empty" — which is what every step but the first needs — has nowhere
else to enter. It leaves again at `mapM_stepBlock_spec_run`, instantiated at `False`: a thread's walk
starts at `{}`, whose `rxThreads` is `[]`, so there is nothing yet to have registered.

Kept out of `RxThreads` deliberately, though both are state predicates threaded the same way.
`RxThreads` is unfolded into the `simp` set at every level; this is not, and an opaque implication is
what keeps `H` pinned by unification against the loop invariant rather than shredded into the
surrounding goal. -/

/-- **What a whole label's worth of branches owes**: every compiled branch is *some* source branch,
refined. Deliberately weaker than the positional `List.Forall₂` a single compiled block satisfies.

Positional pairing is more than any consumer uses — `blockRefines_step` only ever asks for some
source branch matching the target one it was handed, which is `Forall₂.exists_left` — and it is more
than a *label* can supply. `Process.codeTable` lets a label denote the union of every block carrying
it, and nothing in the front end rejects two blocks with one label, so the branch lists at a label
are concatenations rather than a pair of aligned lists. This is what survives that. -/

/-- **One branch, compiled.** The two halves composed: `processPrecondition_spec` for the
precondition, `actionBlock_refines` for the action block, and one `StrongRefinement.Comp` joining
them.

The composition is where the consumption assignments change hands. `processPrecondition_spec`
leaves them on the *precondition's* right edge, which is where the reorder lemmas put them; the pass
puts them on the *action block's* left edge (`Block.prepend`). `Block.reducing_prepend'` is what
says those are the same relation, and after it the join is associativity.

`Br'.action.last` is reported alongside: `Block.prepend` does not touch `last` and
`convertActionBlock` maps it pointwise, so a branch's terminal `goto` survives compilation
unchanged. That is what the block level needs to know its branches still agree on where they go.

And `Registered`: a branch that receives leaves a receiving thread registered, and one that was
registered before this branch stays registered. This is the only place either can be established —
`stepBranch` is the sole writer of `rxThreads` — and the process level is what spends them, to know
that a source process which receives is compiled to one with a thread to drain its channel. -/
