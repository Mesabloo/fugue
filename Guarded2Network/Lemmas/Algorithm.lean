/-!
  The whole algorithm, one step at a time.

  Below this file the two per-step obligations are already proved, one per kind of target thread:
  `algRelatesTo.block_step` for a compiled code thread's block, `algRelatesTo.rx_step` for a
  receiving thread's relay. What is left is the *dispatch* — deciding which of the two a target step
  is — and that is a question about the compiled algebra, not about any state.

  There is no interface for it. Each of the two obligations below resolves the stepping instance
  against the compiled algebra pair `GuardedPlusCal.Algorithm.algebra Ξ Ω algo` /
  `NetworkPlusCal.Algorithm.algebra Ξ Ω algo'` itself, and splits `CodeTable.procReducing` into its
  labelled disjunct — a compiled code block — and its `relay` disjunct — a receiving thread's step.
  The step it is holding is what proves the label is owned, so the unschedulable case never arises.
  The pass's per-process refinement (`ProcessesRefine`) plus the front-end facts (`MailboxUsed`,
  `AlgorithmFresh`) are what that needs and nothing more.

  **The per-step obligation is a `StrongRefinement.Stuttering`, not a `Terminating`.** A receiving
  thread's step is answered with *no* source step at all, so no single-step `Terminating` can be
  stated. `algRelatesTo.stuttering` is that obligation; the reducing, diverging, aborting and blocking
  halves are the framework's `Stuttering.star`, `Stuttering.omega` and `Stuttering.terminating`
  applied to it.

/-! # The pass at this level: the whole algorithm, compiled

  `Algorithm.toNetwork` maps `Process.toNetwork` over the algorithm's processes and keeps the
  global state, so the syntactic half is `Spec.mapM_list` a fourth time and nothing more.

  The semantic half — turning the resulting `ProcessRefines` into the label dispatch
  `algRelatesTo.stuttering` and `.immediateAbort` run — is a different kind of step and is not
  here. It has to go through `Algorithm.algebra`'s by-name lookup on both sides, and it is the first
  place the two languages' `Process.codeTable`s are compared rather than their syntax.
-/

/-! ## `mb` and `rx`, read off the compiled processes

  `algRelatesTo` is indexed by instances (`ι = String × V`) while the pass's data is positional in
  a list, and `Algorithm.algebra` bridges the two by looking a process up under its *name*. So both
  functions are that lookup composed with something local to the compiled process — no existential,
  no choice, and `.none` for a process that has no receiving thread, which is exactly the mailbox a
  receive-free process must have.

  `List.Forall₂.find?_right` is what makes the lookup usable: the two `find?`s walk their lists in
  step, so a target process found under a name is the compilation of the source process found under
  the same one. `ProcessRefines.name_eq` is what makes the two predicates agree on related pairs.
-/

/-- **The mailbox of the process an instance belongs to.** An algorithm has no mailbox; its processes
do, and an instance's is its process's. Found by name, then read off the process's receiving thread —
`.none` when it has none.

The declared `@mailbox` field cannot serve: it is `Option (String × List Expr)`, which carries
neither the generated `inbox` nor a `Ref` — `rxMailbox`'s own doc says what is missing. What the
field is good for is the *decision*, and that enters `procMailbox_eq` below as a hypothesis. -/
def procMailbox (algo' : ComputableNetworkPlusCal.Algorithm) : String × V → Mailbox :=
  λ ⟨name, _⟩ ↦ (algo'.processes.find? (·.name == name)).bind rxMailbox

/-- **What a process declares its mailbox to be, as the pass gets to assume it.** After
`checkReceiveChannels` a `@mailbox` field is present exactly when the process has a `receive` to use
it, so a mailbox assignment that says `.some` is one whose process receives.

Only that direction is needed, and only that direction is a front-end fact. The converse — a process
that receives has a mailbox — is what `BranchesFresh.mbox_some` already carries down the ladder. -/

process found under that same name — the step every clause below opens with, since both algebras
resolve an instance `⟨name, self⟩` by exactly this lookup.

`List.Forall₂.find?_right` is what makes it work: the two `find?`s walk their lists in step, so
agreement on the *predicate* at related pairs is enough, and `ProcessRefines.name_eq` is that
agreement. The target side is the hypothesis rather than the source's because that is the direction
`algRelatesTo.stuttering` and `.immediateAbort` need it — a target step names a target label,
and resolving that label's owning process is the first thing either proof does. -/

and not a `Mailbox` — see `ProcessFresh`. -/

/-- **One target step, answered — and never answered by nothing forever.** The algorithm-level
`Stuttering` refinement, at the target's queued-message count: the source takes *one* step, or it
takes none and that count strictly drops, or it aborts.

The middle disjunct is what a divergence argument needs and `Terminating` cannot express. A
receiving thread's step is answered with no source step at all, so an infinite target run could in
principle be answered by a source that never moves — except that a relay moves a message *out* of a
channel, and `FIFOs.size` counts exactly those. Only a `send` puts one back, and a `send` is a code
thread's step, which does move the source. So the target cannot relay forever without the source
keeping pace.

The proof reads the target step apart into an instance and one of `procReducing`'s two disjuncts,
resolves the owning process (`find?_refines`), and hands the pieces to whichever per-step lemma
applies — `block_step` for the labelled disjunct, `rx_step` for the `relay` one.
`Process.ownedLabels_of_reducing` is what lets the code case start from the step already in hand
rather than from a separate membership hypothesis. A name that resolves to no process has an empty
table on both disjuncts, so both are dispatched first, and separately.

Reassembling the *source's* step is the only thing here that is not dispatch. `Algebra.step` wants a
`CodeTable.procReducing`, which wants the scheduled label to be one the source process owns and has
scheduled, and the memory to bind `selfName`. The first comes from the code branch's label agreement
together with `procRelatesTo`'s `L₂ = L₁`; the second from memory agreement away from the generated
`inbox`, which is not `self` — and since both algebras read `self` off the instance's own identity,
that memory fact needs no translation between the two sides. -/

/-! # The initial state

  A `StrongRefinement` says nothing at all unless the two algorithms' *initial* states are related:
  with `algRelatesTo` never holding, it is vacuously true. What gives `Algorithm.toNetwork_refines`
  content is that every initial state of the compiled algorithm has one of the source's related to
  it, and that is what this section proves.

  Both `init`s have the same shape and their FIFO clause is *identical* on the two sides —
  `Algorithm.toNetwork_spec` reports `algo'.globalState = algo.globalState` for exactly this reason —
  so the source state is built on the target's own FIFO map, and the whole obligation is about the
  instances. There the pass makes three differences to a process, and each is one clause of
  `procRelatesTo`: the entry labels gain the receiving threads' (`ProcessRefines.entryLabels_eq`),
  the locals gain the `inbox` (`ProcessRefines.inits_eq`), and the instance starts receiving on a key.

  Only the last is beyond the pass. Nothing it compiles decides whether a channel's index expressions
  evaluate, whether what they resolve to is a FIFO the module declared, or whether two instances
  resolve to the same one. Those are the front end's, and `InitKeys` is where they enter.
-/

/-- **The key each receiving instance starts on, and what the front end owes about it.** A witness
function rather than an existential per instance, for the reason `algRelatesTo`'s own `ib` is one:
the FIFO clauses speak about every key at once, and a per-instance existential would leave nothing
relating them. -/
structure InitKeys (Ξ : OperatorEnv) (Ω : Model V) (c₀ : String → ComputableGuardedPlusCal.Ref)
  (algo : ComputableGuardedPlusCal.Algorithm) (F : FIFOs V) (key : String × V → ChanKey V) :
    Prop where
  /-- The mailbox channel resolves, in each instance's own initial memory, to that instance's key. -/

        List.Forall₂ (GuardedPlusCal.EvalStep Ξ Ω σ.1) (c₀ p.name).args (key (p.name, self)).2
  /-- And the key names a channel that exists. `algRelatesTo` carries this as an invariant because a
  compiled relay *aborts* where the FIFO is absent and the source has no relay to abort with;
  establishing it at the initial state is this clause. -/
  declared : ∀ p ∈ algo.processes, ∀ self : V, ProcessReceives p →
    F.lookup (key (p.name, self)) ≠ .none
  /-- And no two receiving instances share one — the well-formedness condition that a process set's
  mailbox is indexed by `self` (`WellFormednessError.mailboxNotIndexedBySelf`). Without it one FIFO
  would be accounted against two inboxes, and no relation of `algRelatesTo`'s shape could hold. -/

/-- **The initial states are related — the pass's correctness is not vacuous.** Every initial state
of the compiled algorithm has one of the source's related to it under `algRelatesTo`, at the same
mailbox and receiving labels `Algorithm.toNetwork_refines` is stated against.

The source state is built on the *target's* FIFO map, which is what `hglobal` buys: the two `init`s'
channel clauses are then the same statement, so the map that satisfies one satisfies the other. What
is left is the instances, and each is the target's own with the pass's three differences undone —
`ProcessRefines.inits_eq` to strip the `inbox` back off the initial memory, `.entryLabels_eq` to
strip the receiving threads off the label set, and `InitKeys` to say what the inbox is accounting
for.

`hnames` is the front end's, and is not bookkeeping: `Algorithm.algebra` resolves an instance by
`find?` on its process name, so two processes sharing one would have every instance of the second
running the first's code. It is what pins `find?` to the process an instance actually came from, on
both sides — the target's names are the source's, pointwise, by `ProcessRefines.name_eq`. -/
