/-!
  Statement desugaring: `SurfacePlusCal`'s implicit-fallthrough statement lists become
  `CorePlusCal`'s explicit-`goto`, type-indexed-terminal `Block`s.

  A label may appear inside an `if`/`while`/`either` body, not just at a thread's top level: it
  marks the start of a new addressable atomic block, so it is extracted into its own top-level
  `(label, Block)` entry, with explicit `goto`s stitching control flow back together. `with` is
  the one exception — its body never allows a nested label, `goto`, or `while`, and one found
  there is a hard error.

  A `goto` may only appear as the last statement of its enclosing list. A `while` must be
  immediately preceded by a real label; none is auto-inserted. An `if`/`either` containing a
  label or `goto` must itself be followed by a real label; none is synthesized.

  If a thread's last label runs out of statements without an explicit terminal, `goto Done` is
  inserted — `"Done"` is a reserved sentinel needing no matching label definition.

  `ownLabel`/`fallthrough` and `WithContext`'s bound-variable list are `Reader` effects
  (`SegmentContext`/`WithContext` below); `acc` — the segment's own accumulated statements —
  stays an explicit fold parameter.

namespace SurfacePlusCal
  /-- Names currently bound by an enclosing `with` (innermost first; order doesn't matter),
  threaded as a `Reader` through `Statement.desugarLabelFree` and friends. Nested `with`s
  accumulate rather than replace. Used to reject a `while`, or a write (`assign`/`receive`)
  targeting a with-bound name — a fixed local binding, not a process variable. -/
  structure WithContext where
    boundVars : List String := []

  /-- The `Reader` context `desugarSegment` threads through its recursion: which label (if any)
  owns the segment being built (`none` for an `if`/`either` branch, which has no address of its
  own), and where to `goto` if the segment runs out of statements without an explicit redirect. -/

  variable {β : Type} {m : Type → Type} [Monad m] [MonadDiagnostic DesugarWarning DesugarError m]
    [MonadFresh m] [MonadReaderOf WithContext m] [MonadWithReaderOf WithContext m]

  /-- The reserved sentinel `goto` target meaning "this thread has terminated" — never needs a
  matching label. -/

  abbrev CoreExpr := CoreTLAPlus.Expression (List Annotation)

  /-- The annotation slot every PlusCal node carries through desugaring: the raw comment
  annotations parsed at each site, which `stripEmbeddedTypeAnnotations` later turns into an
  `Option Typ`. Pinned rather than left generic, matching `Declarations.desugarCheck` below —
  collapsing a `multicast` filter has to read `@type` off each component and build one for the
  binder it synthesizes, which no generic annotation type allows. -/
  abbrev CoreAnn := List Annotation

  /-- `x[e₁, …, eₙ]`'s indices, per bracket group, collapsed to `CorePlusCal.Ref`'s own unary
  shape via `SurfaceTLAPlus.wrapIndices`; `.field` segments pass through unchanged. `pos` is the
  enclosing statement's own position.

  No `@@` here: `Ref` is not a position-carrying node in this codebase (neither
  `CorePlusCal.Ref`'s `Functor`/`Traversable` instances nor any downstream pass registers one),
  and every diagnostic about a `Ref` is reported against its enclosing statement's span. -/
  def Ref.desugarRef (pos : SourceSpan) (r : SurfacePlusCal.Ref CoreExpr) : CorePlusCal.Ref CoreExpr :=
    { name := r.name, args := r.args.map (Sum.map id (SurfaceTLAPlus.wrapIndices pos)) }

  /-- Collapse a `multicast`'s surface filter to `CorePlusCal.Multicast`'s single binder.

  `multicast(c, [x₁ ⋈₁ e₁, …, xₙ ⋈ₙ eₙ ↦ v])` reaches every `c[y]` for `y` in the Cartesian
  product of the components, an `∈`-bind contributing its own set and an `=`-bind the singleton
  `{e}` — so the components name the parts of a recipient *tuple* and do not scope over one
  another. One component is already that binder. Several collapse to a fresh one over
  `D₁ \X … \X Dₙ`, with each original name rewritten in `v` to its projection off it, exactly as
  `SurfaceTLAPlus.collapseToSingleBinder` does for a multi-binder function literal.

  The synthesized binder's declared type is the tuple of the components' own, which is available
  only when every one of them carries a `@type`; a filter annotating some but not all warns
  (`partialMulticastAnnotation`) and keeps none, the recipient's type being fixed by the
  channel's declared domain regardless. Annotations of other kinds on a collapsed component are
  dropped with it — `stripEmbeddedTypeAnnotations` is what would otherwise reject them, and
  there is no longer a site for them to sit at. -/

  Checks that no two assignments write the same base variable within one atomic step, on the
  same control path, regardless of indexing (`checkWrite` above) — from both of `assign`'s and
  `receive`'s `Ref`s (the channel counts as a write too, not just the target). `if`/`either`
  branches are separate control paths, checked independently from the same starting set, with
  their writes unioned into what continues past them.

  `while` is not handled the same way: its body never contributes to what follows it, full
  stop, not "unless it diverges" the way a naive `if`-shaped treatment might suggest. Every
  PlusCal `while` iteration is its own atomic step — why a label is required immediately before
  one (`RejectWhileNonfreshExtraction.tla`/`AcceptWhileFreshReuse.tla`) — so "the loop's body
  ran" and "control reached the code after the loop" are never part of the same atomic step, no
  matter what the body contains or how it ends. (This used to propagate the body's writes
  forward unconditionally, which is what made `E0018` fire on, e.g.,
  `while (c) { x := 0; l: … }; x := 1;` — flagging two writes that can never coexist on one
  execution as if they were sequential; `AcceptConflictingAssignAcrossWhileExit.tla` pins the
  fix.) The body is still checked for conflicts within itself, same as any other block.

  `if`/`either` do *not* get the same "body can leave through a goto, so don't propagate its
  writes" treatment, even though a branch certainly can end in one. The desugarer
  (`Thread.desugar`'s `desugarContinuation`, above) requires a real label immediately after any
  `if`/`either` whose branch needs extraction (contains a `goto` or an internal label) — so
  whenever a branch's own writes *could* wrongly merge with sibling code in the same block, that
  sibling code cannot exist: it would already have been rejected as `notFollowedByLabel`, or
  pulled out to its own labelled block. Equivalently, in the type (`Core/CorePlusCal/Syntax.lean`):
  a `Block`'s `begin` entries are always `Statement _ _ false`, so an `if`/`either` with more
  code after it in the same block is thereby `b = false` — and since `if`/`either` share one `b`
  across all their branches, every branch is `b = false` there too, never diverging. A branch
  that *is* allowed to diverge only occurs where the `if`/`either` is itself a block's own tail,
  where there is no "what follows in this block" to propagate into to begin with. Unlike
  `while`'s body, which is a genuinely separate `Block` with its own independent `b` — nothing
  ties it to whatever follows the `while` — an `if`/`either` branch's divergence and "is there
  more in this block" are the same fact, so no extra check is needed here.
