  Recursive `EXTENDS` module resolution — the driver-level orchestration that locates, lexes,
  parses, desugars, and checks a module, recursing on its own `EXTENDS` list for each dependency.

  `compileModule` below is the one function that runs a module's source all the way through to a
  checked module; `Fugue.lean`'s CLI entry point calls it directly for the main module, and
  `resolveModule` calls it again, recursively, for every `EXTENDS`-ed dependency.
-/

/-- Raw module source text by `moduleId`, so `DriverError` can carry just the lightweight key
rather than duplicating a (possibly large) source string into every thrown error — looked up
again only once, at the point an error is finally rendered. -/

  registerSource : String → String → m Unit
  lookupSource : String → m (Option String)
export MonadSourceRegistry (registerSource lookupSource)

/-- The `moduleId` a `DriverError` is tagged with, if any — `none` for the position-free
structural errors (`moduleNotFound`/`ambiguousModule`/`cyclicExtends`), which carry none. -/

  | .typeCheck moduleId _ | .moduleNameMismatch moduleId _ _ => some moduleId
  | .moduleNotFound .. | .ambiguousModule .. | .cyclicExtends .. => none

/-- The source lines to render `err`'s snippet against — the offending module's own, looked up in
`registry` by `moduleId`, not whichever module the caller started compiling from. `none` when
`err` carries no `moduleId`, or the registry has no entry for it; the caller should fall back to
rendering against the main module's own lines.

A pure function of the registry rather than an `IO` action reading a global ref, so rendering a
diagnostic needs no `IO` at all — which is what lets `Driver/Pipeline.lean` hand a caller finished
diagnostic text and lets the regression runner assert on it directly. -/

(`DriverWarning.moduleId`, `Driver/Errors.lean`). -/

failure. -/

/-- The module cache `Ξ`. Keyed by module name alone, not name-plus-hash: a candidate file's hash
isn't known until after it's been located and read, so `resolveModule` looks up by name first,
then compares the returned `CacheEntry.sourceHash` against the freshly-read file's hash. -/

-- The effects `compileModule`/`resolveModule` need beyond ordinary IO: `Γ`'s enclosing `FlagsEnv`
-- (for `-I`'s search path), the resolution stack (cycle detection), the module cache, the source
-- registry, the fresh-name counter, and error reporting. Not a `class abbrev` bundle: two
-- different `MonadReaderOf`/`MonadWithReaderOf` instantiations as parents of the same abbrev
-- collide, so every constraint is listed explicitly on each function instead.

/-- Everything one compile mutates as it runs: the fresh-name counter (`Common/Fresh.lean`), the
source registry (for rendering a diagnostic against its own module's lines), and the module cache
`Ξ`. One value per compile, threaded as a real `StateT` layer rather than a set of global
`IO.Ref`s, so concurrent compiles in one process — which is what the regression runner does — are
independent, and a compile's fresh names don't depend on what ran before it. -/

/-- What `M` sits on: the compile's flags and its mutable state, under plain `IO`. The state layer

/-- The concrete monad `compileModule`/`resolveModule` run at when actually invoked.
`ResolutionStack` is the one genuinely scoped Reader (push-on-recurse, pop-on-return), which is
why it sits above `DiagT`'s own `DriverWarning`/`DriverError` reporting rather than in `Base`.
`compileModule`/`resolveModule` are concrete against this stack, not polymorphic like everything
else here: the per-module warning scoping below (`runScoped`) needs to actually run `DiagT`'s
layer down to a plain value, which is only possible against a fixed concrete stack, not an
abstract `m`. -/

/-- Run an `M` action from the top, with an empty resolution stack — down to `Base`, not to `IO`:
whoever runs `Base` owns the compile's flags and state, and everything past this call (the passes
after type checking, and rendering the diagnostics against the sources this action registered)
still needs both. `Driver/Pipeline.lean` is that owner. -/

extending module (if any — absent when read from stdin), then `-I`'s search path. The builtin
table is checked as one more candidate source, so a name present in both a searched directory
and `builtinModules` is ambiguous, not silently resolved one way.

Two searched directories naming the *same* file contribute one candidate, not two — `-I foo` on
`foo/Main.tla`, where `foo` is already the containing directory, is a duplicate rather than an
ambiguity. Sameness is decided by `IO.FS.realPath`, so a relative and an absolute spelling of one
directory, a `.`/`..` detour, and a symlink all collapse; what a genuine ambiguity then reports is
still each candidate as it was *spelled*, since that is what the user wrote and what they would
have to change. -/

/-- `MonadForeignLookup`'s concrete instance (`WellFormedness/Monad.lean`) — a module's checked
declarations by name: a `.file` hit via the cache `Ξ` (reachable this way only once a dependency
has actually been resolved and cached), falling back to `builtinModules[name]?` for a builtin.
Mirrors `locate`'s own candidate search, minus the not-found/ambiguous error cases — a name
reachable via a checked `Origin.module name` tag has, by construction, already type-checked.

Constrained to `MonadModuleCache` alone rather than taking the surrounding `variable` block's
whole bundle, so it applies at plain `IO` too — `Ξ` is a global `IO.Ref`, so the lookup needs
nothing the driver's own `M` uniquely has. That is what lets the passes running *past* the driver
(`Fugue.lean`'s `checkWellFormed`/`toComputable` calls, against `IO`) use this instance instead of
declaring a second copy of it. -/

/-- Run `act`'s `M`-action down through the current `ResolutionStack` and `DiagT`'s `Base`,
producing the exact `List DriverWarning` it `tell`'d and its `Except`-wrapped result as plain
data. This is the only way to observe either once a `throw` is in play: `MonadWriter.listen` has
nowhere to put warnings once the value they'd pair with disappears on a throw (same wall a
generic `ExceptT ε N` composition would hit), so this sidesteps `listen` entirely and goes
straight to `DiagT.run`. Running down to `Base` rather than all the way to `IO` is what keeps
`act`'s state writes — the source registry entries it made, the cache entries it stored, the
fresh names it consumed — even when `act` threw. -/

/-- Run `act`; if it throws, flush the warnings `act` produced (up to the throw), report `name`
as `.failed` via `onModuleEvent`, and re-throw the error unchanged. If it succeeds, `tell` its
warnings back into the ambient accumulator — so they keep flowing toward whichever later stage,
or the final per-module flush, is next — and return its value. `compileModule` needs this exact
flush/report/re-throw-or-forward shape at three separate points. -/

/-- Every name/type binding a checked declaration introduces, computed from an already-checked
`Decl` rather than by re-checking one. Used to expose an `EXTENDS`-ed dependency's own
declarations into a fresh `Γ₀` — all of a dependency's `params`/`defs` come into scope, not just
its exported operators. PlusCal-internal declarations are never included, since they never leak
into a module's `Γ` in the first place. `moduleName` is what *declared* this `Decl` — tags every
returned binding's `Origin` accordingly, so it must be the declaring module's own name and never
that of a module the declaration merely reaches through (`ResolvedDep.bindings` below).

A `constants`/`variables` binding is never a scheme (`Binding.isScheme := false`); an
`operator`/`function` binding always is, any arity — matches `Elaborator/Declarations.lean`'s
`checkDeclaration`, whose returned bindings follow the identical rule. This is what lets a 0-ary
builtin like `Bags`'s `EmptyBag` (`Driver/Builtins.lean`) get freshened on every reference without
`Driver/Builtins.lean` needing any change — arity alone (already present on every `Decl.operator`)
decides `isScheme`. -/

private def TypedModule.ownBindings (mod : TypedModule) : List (String × Binding) :=
  (mod.declarations₁ ++ mod.declarations₂).flatMap (Decl.bindings mod.name)

/-- What `compileModule`/`resolveModule` hand back for one module.

`inherited` is what that module's own `EXTENDS` list brought into scope, each entry already tagged
with the module that *declared* it, and `bindings` below appends the module's own declarations to
it — so `EXTENDS` is transitive, and identically so for a builtin and for a `.tla` file on disk.
Neither field is a choice a construction site gets to make: there is no way to build a
`ResolvedDep` that exports its own declarations but not its dependencies'.

The `inherited` entries are carried here rather than recomputed by the caller from `mod`'s
declaration list because a re-exported declaration is indistinguishable from an own one inside a
`List Decl`: a caller folding `Decl.bindings` over a merged list has no name to tag with but the
re-exporting module's, and would attribute `Naturals`'s `<` to whichever of `Sequences`/
`Integers`/`FiniteSets`/`Bags`/user module it arrived through. `Origin` is what
`TypedTLAPlus.builtinOpOf?` and `Network2Go.compileBuiltinCall` dispatch on, so that
misattribution is not cosmetic: it makes a builtin uncompilable. -/

/-- Run a module's source all the way through to a checked module: lex, parse, resolve
annotations, desugar TLA⁺ expressions and the embedded PlusCal algorithm, resolve every
`EXTENDS`-ed dependency (`resolveModule`, recursing into `compileModule` for anything not already
satisfied by the cache or a builtin), merge their exported declarations into an initial `Γ`, and
check.

`onModuleProgress name` fires twice: once as soon as `name` is known (right after parsing), and
again once its `EXTENDS` dependencies finish resolving, to refocus display back onto this module
once its dependencies are no longer "current".

`onModuleEvent name .built` fires once this module is fully checked, `.failed` if its own
processing throws — the one place either is reported for this module (a dependency's own outcome
is reported inside its own recursive `compileModule` call, never duplicated here).

`moduleId` is the registry key `DriverError`'s variants tag themselves with, registered against
`source` before lexing runs. For a dependency this is the `EXTENDS`-requested name; for the main
module it's whatever identifier `Fugue.lean` passes.

`isRoot` marks the compile's own module, as opposed to an `EXTENDS`-ed dependency, and suppresses
its `.built`: type checking is where a *dependency* is finished, but the root goes on through
every pass past the driver, so reporting it built here would claim success for a compile that can
still fail. `Driver/Pipeline.lean` reports the root's outcome once it knows it. `.failed` is not
suppressed — a driver failure ends the compile there, so it is already the final word.

Returns a `ResolvedDep` rather than the bare `TypedModule` because the bindings this module's
`EXTENDS` list brought in are known only here, and a dependent needs them to re-export them in
turn (`ResolvedDep.bindings`). `recomputed` is always `true`: reaching this function is what being
recomputed means. A caller that only wants the module itself — `Driver/Pipeline.lean`, for the
root — takes `.mod`. -/

/-- The `EXTENDS`-specific wrapper around `compileModule`: locate `name` (`locate` above, error on
not-found/ambiguous), check `Ξ`, and recompute if `name`'s source changed or anything it
transitively depends on changed. The returned `ResolvedDep` carries the checked module, the
bindings it brings into scope, and whether it was actually recomputed just now — the last threaded
up so its dependents can tell whether they need to recompute in turn.

Fires `onModuleEvent name .replayed` on the one path that never touches `compileModule` (a cache
hit with nothing changed); every other outcome is reported by whichever `compileModule` call this
makes. Not for `.builtin`, which is static. `onModuleProgress name` fires once, at the top of the
`.file` case.

`EXTENDS` is transitive, for a builtin and for a `.tla` file alike: every path here supplies
`ResolvedDep.inherited`, and `ResolvedDep.bindings` puts it ahead of the module's own bindings, so
a later own declaration still shadows an inherited one of the same name. Each inherited binding
keeps the `Origin` its declaring module gave it — `Naturals`'s `<` stays `Naturals!<` whether it
is reached through `EXTENDS Sequences` or through a user module that `EXTENDS Naturals` itself.

On the one path that replays a cached module without recompiling it, `inherited` is rebuilt from
the dependency resolutions the cache check already had to perform for change detection: nothing
recompiles, and by that check's own conclusion — no dependency recomputed — those bindings are
what the cached module was compiled against. -/
