/-!
  One compile, end to end, as a function: source text in, a `PipelineResult` out. No process exit,
  no printing, no progress animation — those belong to whoever is driving.

  `Driver/Modules.lean`'s `compileModule` only takes a module as far as type checking, and caches
  that; every pass after it (well-formedness, `Typed2Computable`, `Computable2Guarded`,
  `Guarded2Network`) runs once, here, against the checked main module rather than per `EXTENDS`
  dependency. It is separate from the CLI because two consumers need it: the CLI itself, and
  `tests/regression`'s runner.

-- `Stage` itself lives in `Common/Diagnostics/Stage.lean`, so the diagnostic registry can name a
-- stage without depending on the pipeline that runs them; it is re-exported here, where it is
-- actually used.

/-- Any way a compile can fail, from any stage. One type so a caller handles one thing;
`PipelineError.stage` recovers where it came from. -/

its own module's lines (an error inside an `EXTENDS`-ed dependency is not about the main module),
looked up in `sources`; everything past the driver only ever concerns the main module, so it
renders against `mainLines`. Pure — rendering a diagnostic needs no `IO`. -/

group of stages that can produce one: everything up to type checking reports through
`DriverWarning`, and well-formedness through its own. The passes after it still report at
`MonadDiagnostic Empty ε` and so cannot warn at all; each grows a constructor here on the day it
can. -/

Separate from `renderWarnings` because "which warnings survive `-W`" and "what they look like" are
different questions, and more than one caller wants the first without the second — `PipelineResult
.warnings` is deliberately the *unfiltered* record of what the passes raised, so anything asking
whether a warning is suppressed has to apply the filter, and should not have to re-implement it. -/
