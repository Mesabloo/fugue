variable {m : Type → Type} [Monad m] [MonadElaborator m] [MonadPendingBounds m]

/-- Needed for the `partial def`s below to type-check at all (an arbitrary `m` isn't otherwise
known nonempty). -/
private local instance {α} [Inhabited α] : Inhabited (m α) := ⟨pure default⟩

/--
  Eliminates every `mvar` node inside `e`, walking bottom-up so a nested `mvar` resolves before
  an outer one that might wrap it. Each metavariable defaults to its recorded upper bound, if
  there's exactly one; no recorded bound is an unconstrained-metavariable error, and more than one
  is unsupported (would need per-site tracking to substitute soundly).

  Only eliminates `Expression.mvar` wrapper nodes, not `Typ.mvar` occurrences embedded in a node's
  stored type field — those are resolved by `resolveMVars` below, as a second pass.

/-- Best-effort metavariable substitution for a `Typ`, named after `Lean.Meta.instantiateMVars`
since it does the same job for the same reason: an already-resolved metavariable (e.g. pinned by
an earlier operand in the same call) is substituted with its solution; one that's never been
constrained is left as `Typ.mvar n` (rendered `?n`) rather than erroring. Originally written for a
`Typ` about to be embedded in a *thrown* `TCError` (so the message shows a concrete type instead of
a raw `?n`), but the same gap shows up whenever a `Typ` obtained from `inferExpr` is about to be
pattern-matched against a specific shape (`.record`/`.set`/`.function`/…): a scheme operator's
result can carry a metavariable its own argument-checking already solved (`subtype`'s `_, .mvar b`
case, in `Elaborator/Subtyping.lean`), but nothing rewrites the `Typ` tree in place, so a bare
structural match sees `.mvar n` and not the solution — e.g. `\E m \in DOMAIN someBag : m.field`
fails to elaborate `m.field` even though `m`'s type is fully known by then. Calling this before
such a match (as `Elaborator/Expressions.lean`'s domain-binder/record-access/index/`EXCEPT`-step
rules do) fixes that: read-only over the metavariable context, so calling it anywhere never affects
checking's soundness, only whether an already-decided type is visible yet. -/
