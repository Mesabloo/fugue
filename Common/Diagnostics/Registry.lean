/-!
  Every diagnostic code the compiler can emit, with the stage that emits it and a one-line
  summary. This is the *only* place a number is bound to a meaning: each `CompilerDiagnostic`
  instance names an entry here (`Diagnostics.unexpectedToken.code`) rather than writing a literal,
  so a code that a diagnostic uses but the registry does not list cannot exist.

  Numbers are allocated sequentially and are **permanent**: never renumbered, never reused. A
  diagnostic that disappears keeps its entry, marked `retired`, so an old build log or an old
  `fugue explain E0042` stays meaningful. Add new diagnostics at the end.

  `fugue explain <code>` prints `docs/diagnostics/<code>.md`; the summary here is what
  `fugue explain --list` shows, and what the regression runner's coverage report labels a code
  with.
