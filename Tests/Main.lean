/-!
  The regression suite's entry point: `lake test -- [FILTER…]`.

  Fixtures are compiled **in-process**, one `runPipelineIO` call each, rather than by spawning the
  `fugue` binary. That is what makes the interesting checks possible at all — where a compile
  stopped, which diagnostic it produced, what it built — none of which survives the trip through a
  process boundary and an exit code. It also means the runner and the compiler are built together,
  so a fixture can never be checked against a stale binary.

  One failure mode is still not caught: a hard crash in native code, which takes the process down
  before any report can be made. A Lean exception, the common case, *is* caught — `IO.asTask` hands
  it back as an `Except`, and the fixture reports a failed "no crash" check — and a fixture that
  never terminates is abandoned by `withTimeout` and reported by name.
-/

/-- One fixture: a `.tla` file and what its name says about it. -/
structure Fixture : Type where
  /-- The filename, e.g. `reject_bad_arity.tla`. Also the `moduleId` the compile runs under, so
  diagnostics are tagged with something a reader can find. -/
  name : String
  /-- Its full path. -/
  path : System.FilePath
  /-- What it claims. -/
  expectation : Expectation
  /-- Why its sidecar could not be read, when it could not be. -/
  sidecarError : Option String := none
  deriving Inhabited

/-- Where the fixtures live, relative to the repository root. Two spellings because the directory
holding them also holds this runner's own modules, whose Lean module names capitalise it: the
working tree calls it `Tests`, and git's index still records the fixtures under `tests`. On a
case-insensitive filesystem those are one directory and either entry finds it; on a case-sensitive
one they may genuinely be two, and the runner should not care which. -/
private def fixturesLayouts : List System.FilePath := ["Tests" / "regression", "tests" / "regression"]

/-- The fixture directory. `$FUGUE_FIXTURES` overrides; otherwise the search is anchored at the
**executable** and walks up looking for `tests/regression`, exactly as `fugue explain` finds its
docs corpus. Anchoring at the working directory would be wrong for the same reason it is there:
`lake test` can be run from anywhere in (or outside) the checkout, and the binary always knows
where it was built. -/
private def findFixturesDir : IO (Option System.FilePath) := do
  if let some dir ← IO.getEnv "FUGUE_FIXTURES" then
    return some ↑dir

  for _ in [0:6] do

    for layout in fixturesLayouts do
      if ← (here / layout).isDir then
        return some (here / layout)
    dir := here.parent
  return none

/-- Every `.tla` file in `dir`, in filename order, paired with its expectation: what the filename
implies, with `<fixture>.expect.json` applied on top.

A name matching no convention still yields a `Fixture` — reported as a skip with a note rather
than silently dropped, since a mistyped prefix would otherwise take a fixture out of the suite
with nothing to show for it. A sidecar that will not load yields one too, carrying the parse error
as `sidecarError`: the fixture is then reported as a failure rather than run, because a sidecar
nobody can read is a broken assertion, not an absent one. -/

/-- The `FlagsEnv` a fixture compiles under: bare apart from colour, plus whichever `-W` names
`suppressed` turns off and whichever `-I` directories its sidecar asked for. Bare so that what a
fixture asserts is what the compiler does by *default* — a fixture that needs a flag to be
interesting should say so, not inherit it from the harness, which is exactly what the sidecar's
`searchPath` is. Colour follows the runner's own setting, since the only place these diagnostics go
is its failure output. -/

    -- The one exception to "bare": a fixture that asks for a `go build` is emitted under a
    -- library package rather than `main`, which nothing else asserts on. See `Tests/GoBuild.lean`

/-- How often `withTimeout` looks at the work it is waiting on. Small enough that the poll is
invisible next to a fixture's own compile, large enough that the wait costs no measurable CPU. -/
private def pollIntervalMs : UInt32 := 2

/-- Run `act`, giving up after `timeoutMs`. `none` means it did not finish in time.

Lean has no timed wait, so this polls the work task against a deadline. Racing the work against an
`IO.sleep` alarm instead would leave the losing sleep outstanding, and the runtime joins outstanding
tasks before the process exits — so every fixture would add its full timeout to the suite's runtime.

Polling spawns nothing to wait *with*, so a fixture that finishes leaves nothing behind. It still
cannot *stop* one that does not: a Lean task has no cancellation, so an abandoned compile keeps
running until the process exits. The timeout is a backstop, not something a fixture should reach. -/

/-- Compile one fixture and judge it.

`suppressible` costs one extra compile per name: `-W` is a flag, and the only honest way to check
that a flag suppresses something is to pass it and look. Those re-runs contribute their own checks
and nothing else — their diagnostics are not reported, since the first compile's are the ones that
describe the fixture. -/

workers registering and reading positions do not interfere with each other either. `jobs` above 1
