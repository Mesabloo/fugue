---- MODULE AcceptReExportedNaturalsViaBags ----
\* Expect: accepted, all the way through Go code generation. The `EXTENDS Bags` surface of the
\* re-export bug `AcceptReExportedNaturalsViaSequences` covers: `Bags` `EXTENDS TLC, Naturals`,
\* so `<`/`+` reach this module re-exported and must stay tagged `Naturals`, not `Bags`.
\* This one showed the bug as a *different* diagnostic than the other three -- `Bags!<` matches
\* `compileBuiltinCall`'s `Bags` arm, which reports `E0061` ("the Bags module has no runtime
\* representation") rather than `E0060` -- so it is worth its own fixture rather than being folded
\* into the `Integers` one.
\* No `Bags` operator is referenced -- most now have real Go codegen (`BagOfAll`/`BagCardinality`
\* stay `E0061`-rejected), so a wrongly-`Bags`-tagged one would no longer reliably fail the way it
\* did when this fixture was written. The re-exported `Naturals` operators are the whole point
\* here regardless of that.
