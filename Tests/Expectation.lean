  What a fixture claims about itself.

  Two sources, in order. A fixture's **filename** (`accept_`/`reject_`/`skip_`) gives the same
  information `tests/regression/run.sh` worked from, and is enough on its own — every fixture runs
  with no authoring work. A `<fixture>.expect.json` **sidecar** next to the `.tla` then says the
  things a filename cannot: which stage a rejection must come from, which code it must carry, which
  warnings must fire.

  JSON and not TOML because `Lean.Data.Json` ships `FromJson` deriving and there is no TOML parser
  to hand. Prose stays out of it — a fixture's `\* Expect: …` header explains *why*, in the `.tla`,
  where a reader of the fixture will see it; JSON has no comments, and duplicating the prose here
  would only let the two drift.

  A sidecar is validated on load, not on use: an unknown stage name, or a code the registry does
  not list, is reported against the fixture rather than becoming a check that quietly never fires.

  on a bare search path. -/

  builds once a `<Fixture>.stub.go` supplies the definition Go expects the user to write. -/

convention — which the runner reports rather than quietly ignoring, since an unrecognised name is
usually a typo that would otherwise take the fixture out of the suite.

Fixtures are named `<Prefix><WhatItTests>.tla`, in CamelCase, because TLA⁺ requires a module's
file to be named after the module: `EXTENDS Foo` looks for `Foo.tla` and nothing else. A snake_case
name therefore gives a fixture an `EXTENDS` that can never resolve, so it silently tests nothing. -/

  ### The sidecar's own shape

  A separate structure from `Expectation`, with every field optional, rather than `FromJson` on
  `Expectation` directly. Two reasons: an absent field must mean "keep what the filename decided",
  which is not the same as "the field's own default" — they differ for `outcome` — and the wire
  format names stages and codes as *strings*, which have to be checked against the registry before
  they can become an `Expectation`'s typed fields.

at the module's own directory. `FilePath.join` returns an absolute entry unchanged, so an absolute
