  The individual assertions made about one compile.

  Every check is a pure function of an `Expectation` and a `PipelineResult`, and they all run:
  a fixture reports *all* of its mismatches at once rather than stopping at the first, because
  "wrong stage" and "wrong code" are usually one edit apart and finding them one run at a time is
  wasted time.

  A check can report `.skip`, meaning "this fixture says nothing about that". That is a real,
  distinct answer from `.pass`: with no sidecars yet, every rejection's stage is unasserted, and
  reporting those as passes would make the suite look like it checks something it does not.

algorithm that stops there stopped early. -/

nothing to interpret: the compile either produced an error or it did not. -/

the registry guarantees it names exactly one diagnostic. -/

/-- Where the error pointed. Separate from `checkErrorCode` because the backtracking bug this suite
guards against keeps the code and the stage and only moves the span — `first`/`sepBy1` rewinding a
consumed failure back to the start of the enclosing production. The sidecar string is matched
against the span as it prints after `at `: a full span when the sidecar writes one
(`"2:24-2:25"`), otherwise just the start cursor (`"2:24"`). -/

/-- Which `notesOf` positions the error carried, in order. Same rendering idiom as
`checkErrorPosition`, decided independently per entry: each sidecar string is matched against its
corresponding note's span as a full span when the sidecar writes one (`"2:24-2:25"`), otherwise
just the start cursor (`"2:24"`). -/

/-- Which warnings fired, by code and count.

Reads `warnings`, the unfiltered record of what the passes raised, rather than `reportedWarnings`.
The runner compiles a fixture with no `-W` flags, so the two agree — but the fixture is asserting
what the *compiler produces*, which is the thing that should not change silently. What `-W` then
shows is `checkSuppression`'s question.

Strict: a warning the fixture did not list is a failure unless it opted into
`allowExtraWarnings`. That is the whole value of the check — a new spurious warning anywhere in
the corpus has to be acknowledged by someone, rather than accumulating unnoticed the way it does
when nothing looks at warnings at all. -/

/-- `suppressible`'s check, which needs a *second* compile and so cannot be a pure function of the
first: `r` is the fixture compiled under `flags`, which turn `warningName` off, and the warning must
be gone while the outcome stays what it was.

Asserts against `reportedWarnings`, not `warnings`. The distinction is the compiler's own design and
not an accident: a pass raises every warning it finds, and `-W` decides which of them are reported.
`warnings` is therefore never affected by `-W`, and a check reading it would pass no matter what the
flag did. -/
