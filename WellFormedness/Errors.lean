/-! The well-formedness pass's diagnostics: one named error variant per violation, plus the one
non-fatal finding — a `@mailbox` nothing receives on, which is dropped rather than rejected. -/

/-- The well-formedness pass's errors. -/
inductive WellFormednessError : Type
  /-- A `goto` targets a label that doesn't exist anywhere in its process (`"Done"` always
  counts as existing). -/
  | unknownLabel (pos : SourceSpan) (label : String)
  /-- `"Done"` used as a real, user-defined label. -/
  | redefinedDone (pos : SourceSpan)
  /-- A name is declared more than once in a scope where every name must be fresh. -/
  | duplicateName (pos : SourceSpan) (name : String)
  /-- A name shadows an already-in-scope name, in a scope where shadowing isn't allowed. -/
  | shadowedName (pos : SourceSpan) (name : String)
  /-- A channel-shaped value appears inside an ordinary expression — only `send`/`receive`'s
  channel argument and `multicast`'s target may reference one. No `name` field: the offending
  subexpression need not be a bare variable (e.g. `IF b THEN ch1 ELSE ch2`), so `τ` (the
  Channel-shaped type actually found) is the only thing always available, matching
  `TCError.notAChannelType`'s own shape. -/
  | channelInExpression (pos : SourceSpan) (τ : TypedTLAPlus.Typ)
  /-- A `variables`/`with`-declared name (algorithm-level, process-level, or `with`-bound) has
  a Channel-shaped type — the `channels`/`fifos` forms are the only legitimate way to declare
  one. -/
  | channelTypedVariable (pos : SourceSpan) (name : String)
  /-- A process's own `localState.channels`/`.fifos` isn't empty — defense-in-depth; the parser
  already guarantees this today. -/
  | nonEmptyLocalChannels (pos : SourceSpan) (process : String)
  /-- The PlusCal algorithm itself declares algorithm-level `variables` (shared mutable state
  across all processes) — only `fifos` is allowed at that level. -/
  | globalPlusCalVariable (pos : SourceSpan) (name : String)
  /-- A reference inside the algorithm resolves to a TLA⁺ module-level `VARIABLE` — `definedIn`
  names the module that actually declared it (own or, via `EXTENDS`, a dependency's). -/
  | globalTLAPlusVariable (pos : SourceSpan) (name : String) (definedIn : String)
  /-- A temporal formula or action operator (`[]`, `<>`, `ENABLED`, `UNCHANGED`, `'`, `^+`,
  `^*`, `^#`) appears somewhere the algorithm's expressions reach — directly in a statement
  (`path := []`) or transitively, through an operator/function call chain (`path` the sequence
  of operator names traversed to get there, innermost first). -/
  | bareTemporalOrAction (pos : SourceSpan) (op : String) (path : List String)
  /-- An unbounded quantifier (`\A x : P`/`\E x : P`/`CHOOSE x : P`, no domain) appears
  somewhere the algorithm's expressions reach — same direct-vs-transitive `path` shape as
  `bareTemporalOrAction`. -/
  | unboundedQuantifier (pos : SourceSpan) (path : List String)
  /-- A process `receive`s from a channel other than the one it already listens on — its declared
  `@mailbox` if it has one, otherwise the channel its first `receive` names. `expected`/`found` are
  the two channels' names; they can be equal and the channels still differ, when the index
  expressions do (`agt[self]` vs `agt[other]`), which `indicesDiffer` distinguishes. -/
  | receiveChannelMismatch (pos : SourceSpan) (process : String) (expected : String)
      (found : String) (indicesDiffer : Bool)
  /-- A `∈`-shaped process (a process *set*) receives from a channel whose index path does not
  mention `self`, so every instance of the set would drain the same FIFO. -/
  | mailboxNotIndexedBySelf (pos : SourceSpan) (process : String) (channel : String)
  /-- A process `receive`s without declaring a `@mailbox`. The channel a process listens on is
  the one thing `Guarded2Network`'s single `inbox` per instance is indexed by, so it has to be
  written down rather than inferred from whichever `receive` the walk happens to reach first. -/
  | receiveWithoutMailbox (pos : SourceSpan) (process : String) (channel : String)
  /-- Two processes of one algorithm carry the same name. Separate from `duplicateName`, which is
  about a *scope*: process names are not in any declaration scope — a process and a variable may
  share a name — but they are what the semantics dispatches an instance on, so they must be
  distinct among themselves. -/
  | duplicateProcessName (pos : SourceSpan) (name : String)
  /-- Two blocks of one algorithm carry the same label. Separate from `duplicateName`: labels are
  their own namespace (`WellFormedness/Labelling.lean`'s `Process.labels`), not a declaration
  scope, and — matching the original PlusCal-to-TLA⁺ translator, whose labels each become their
  own top-level TLA⁺ definition — that namespace spans the *whole algorithm*, not just one
  process. Within one process it is additionally an operational hazard: `Process.codeTable`
  treats a label as denoting the *union* of every block carrying it, so a duplicate isn't rejected
  there — it silently becomes a non-deterministic choice between the blocks, which is never what
  the source program meant when it wrote a `goto` to that name. -/
  | duplicateLabel (pos : SourceSpan) (label : String)
  deriving Repr, Inhabited, BEq

/-- Renders a direct-vs-transitive `path` breadcrumb (innermost first) as "directly in a
statement" or "reachable via `f` → `g` → …", shared by `bareTemporalOrAction`/
`unboundedQuantifier`'s messages. -/
private def renderPath : List String → String
  | [] => "directly in a statement"
  | path@(_ :: _) => "reachable via " ++ String.intercalate " → " (path.map λ op ↦ s!"`{op}`")
