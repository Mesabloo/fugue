// Multicast sends to every recipient in a set: for each address a in to, it
// sends f(a) along the endpoint ch[a].
//
// This is the whole compiled form of the source language's multicast statement.
// The iteration lives here rather than in generated code because there is
// nothing for generated code to decide: a specification's multicast fixes no
// order on the sends and gives no way to observe one, so any order refines it.
// That freedom is the caller's to keep — this implementation walks the set as
// it is stored, but nothing in the contract promises that, and a future
// implementation may send concurrently.
//
// The payload is a function of the recipient rather than a value because the
// source construct binds the recipient and may mention it: multicast(c, [n \in
// Nodes |-> Request(n)]) sends a different message to each n. A payload that
// ignores its argument is the constant case, and costs one call per recipient.
//
// The channel is a map because a multicast target is always an indexed channel:
// the recipient is what indexes it. A recipient with no entry in ch is a
// specification indexing a function outside its domain, which is undefined in
// TLA+, so this panics rather than silently dropping the message — the same
// choice the rest of the runtime makes for an undefined expression.
//
// A recipient set is also always finite in practice — a network has finitely
// many addresses — but the type does not enforce that, and Set keeps its
// representation private to its own package, so there is no way from here to
// walk it directly any more. Delivery is phrased instead as the universal
// statement SetForall already knows how to decide — every recipient received
// its message — which panics on an infinite to for the same reason it would
// panic deciding any other universally quantified statement over one. The
// predicate itself always reports success; what matters is that, unlike
// SetExists, SetForall does not stop at the first true, so every recipient is
// actually visited rather than delivery stopping after one.
