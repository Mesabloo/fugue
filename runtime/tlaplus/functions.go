// LazyFunction represents a TLA+ function t -> u.
//
// The graph is not computed at the definition site — a function's domain may be
// large and most of it never applied — so the structure keeps the domain, a
// generator computing one value on demand, and the cache of what has been
// computed or overridden so far. This mirrors how TLC evaluates functions.
//
// The cache is held by pointer, and that matters: LazyFunction is passed by
// value, so the two things the cache is for want different treatment.
//
//   - FnApply memoizes, and must make its result visible to every copy of the
//     LazyFunction it was applied to. It overwrites the map header through this
//     pointer, which every such copy shares. Persistence lives in the nodes,
//     not the header, so replacing the header is cheap and leaves every map
//     derived from it untouched.
//   - FnOverload implements EXCEPT, and must not let the override escape to the
//     function being overloaded. It simply keeps the fresh header Insert
//     returns, leaving the original pointer aimed at the original map.
//
// Storing the map by value would satisfy the second at the cost of the first:
// FnApply's write would land in its own copy of the struct and be discarded on
// return, silently, making every recursive function exponential.
//
// The keys are ordered by a dictionary rather than by Go's ==, which is exactly
// what the builtin map cannot accept, since comparable is not implementable for
// a custom type. Hence the treemap, which takes its ordering as a parameter —
// the same dictionary-passing shape as this package's own operations, and the
// precedent for them.

// written. So the function is allocated first with no generator, and the
// generator is then installed as a closure over it. Go closures capture the

// FnApply, never during construction — the variable holds the finished

// panics instead, and -Wunsafe warns at every call site.

// that actually puts a function inside a set fails loudly at that point rather
// than failing to compile.
//
// A real implementation is known and not written yet. TLC orders functions by
// representing one as an explicit finite graph and comparing domain then range
// pointwise, with a per-value-kind ordinal breaking ties across kinds. Ours is
// lazy, so matching that means forcing the whole domain through gen before
// comparing — which is well defined, and compares the graph rather than the
// cache, two functions with equal graphs having possibly memoized different
// subsets of them. The cost is forcing, on a path nothing yet exercises; the
// question is left for the first specification that needs it.
