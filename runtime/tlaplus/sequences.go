// observed, and its contents are meaningless — it exists so that indexing needs
// no arithmetic, which is the operation sequences see most.
//
// A sequence of n elements therefore has an underlying length of n+1, with one
// exception: the zero value (a nil slice) is a valid empty sequence, so that
// `var s Seq[T]` in generated code needs no initialization. Len accounts for
// it.
