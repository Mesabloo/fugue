  Building the `Ord` dictionary a TLA⁺ type is ordered by.

  The runtime represents ordering as a *value* — `tlaplus.Ord[T]` is a struct of two functions,
  `Eq` and `Lt` — rather than as an interface a type implements. Go has no conditional method sets,
  so `Set[T]` could not declare a comparison that calls `T`'s; a dictionary sidesteps that, keeps
  every container `[T any]`, and makes nesting ordinary composition (`Set[Set[Int]]`'s dictionary is
  `SetOrd(SetOrd(IntOrd))`). Every runtime operation that compares takes one.

  So `ordDict` is a second fold over `Typ`, mirroring `compileTyp` constructor for constructor: one
  produces the type, the other the dictionary ordering it. The two must agree, since a `Set` does
  not record which dictionary built it and every operation on it has to be handed the same one —
  that they are derived from the same `Typ` is what guarantees it.

  Three kinds of answer:

  - **Closed expressions**, for everything built out of the runtime's own types: a package-level
    value (`tlaplus.IntOrd`) or a constructor applied to its components (`tlaplus.SetOrd(…)`).
  - **A literal**, for records and tuples. These compile to *anonymous* Go structs, which can carry
    no methods — but a dictionary needs none, so the comparison functions are written out inline at
    each use. This is what removed the need for generated named types and a mangling scheme; Go
    identifies anonymous struct types structurally, so two identically-shaped records are already
    the same type, and `compileTyp`'s field sorting is what makes the shapes coincide.
  - **A parameter**, for a rigid type variable, bound by the enclosing definition.

  Rejected wholesale: `.operator`. Operators compile to Go `func`s, which have no equality at all,
  and TLA⁺ operators are not values, so one can never appear inside a set, a sequence, a record or
  a function's domain.

/--
  The dictionary for a record or a tuple, as a literal beside the anonymous struct type it orders.

  Equality is componentwise; the order is lexicographic in the struct's own field order. Both are
  written against `goτ`, which the caller has already computed, so that the type is spelled
  identically in the literal's type argument and in both function signatures — Go compares
  anonymous struct types structurally, and a mismatch would not be a type error, just a different
  type.
