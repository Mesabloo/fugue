  Compiling TLA⁺ types into Go types.

  `Core.Go.Syntax` is real Go rather than a statement layer parameterized over TLA⁺ types, so the
  translation is this pass's own work.

  - **Primitives go to the runtime's newtypes, not Go's builtins.** `Bool`/`Int`/`Str` compile to
    `tlaplus.Bool`/`tlaplus.Int`/`tlaplus.Str` rather than `bool`/`int`/`string`, because every
    value in generated code has to implement `Eq`/`Ord` and Go forbids implementing an interface
    for a type declared in another package. `Go.Typ`'s own `.bool`/`.int`/`.str` are still used
    by the pass, for the Go-level scaffolding a specification never sees — a branch function's
    `guard bool`, a scheduler's loop condition.
  - **Records compile to a struct with their fields sorted by name.** TLA⁺ records are unordered,
    so `[a ↦ 1, b ↦ 2]` and `[b ↦ 2, a ↦ 1]` are the same value and must compile to the same Go
    type; a struct's fields are ordered, so a canonical order has to be imposed. Sorting also
    makes the tuple encoding fall out unchanged, `proj1 … projn` already being in order.
  - **`Channel(τ)` has no case.** Channels are not first-class in Distributed PlusCal — one is
    never stored, passed, or placed in a data structure — so a channel type reaching this
    function means it turned up in an ordinary value position, which the well-formedness checks
    on channel declarations already rule out (`Typ.isChannelLike`, `WellFormedness/
    Declarations.lean`). The channel *declarations* themselves don't come through here: they
    become the process's `Network` parameter, built by the process-wiring compilation.

/--
  Compiles a TLA⁺ type into its Go representation.

  Fails only on types that cannot appear in a value position by the time this pass runs — see the
  module doc for `Channel(τ)`, and `Core/ComputableTLAPlus/Syntax.lean` for why no metavariable
  survives type checking.
