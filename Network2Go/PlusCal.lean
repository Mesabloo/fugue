/-!
  Compiling Network PlusCal processes into Go, on top of the TLA⁺ half
  (`Network2Go.{Typ,Expression,Definition}`) and the lock assignment (`Network2Go.Locks`).

  **The shape.** An atomic block does not become a Go block. Each of its branches becomes a
  top-level function returning `bool` — "did I fire" — and the block itself becomes a scheduler
  function looping over them, picking one at random per iteration and stopping once one returns
  `true`. Control then leaves through `goto`, which spawns a goroutine running the *next* block's
  scheduler rather than calling it: a chain of blocks is unbounded, and Go's goroutine stacks are
  small and growable, so a tail call would eventually overflow one.

  The loop is a busy-wait, and knowingly so: a failed iteration still
  pays for its lock acquisitions and its guard evaluation. Condition variables would avoid that
  and are much harder to state a correctness property about. Go's runtime also preempts on
  channel operations, which is exactly what `Acquire`/`Release` are, so the loop does not spin
  freely in practice.

  **Every function takes every lock**, whether it acquires it or not, because a `goto` may hand
  control to a block with a different footprint and the lock has to reach it.
  Which locks a piece of code *acquires* is decided per **branch**, not per block:
  two branches of one block touching disjoint variables should not serialize against each other.

  **Locks are storage, not just mutual exclusion.** A process-local variable exists only inside
  the struct its lock carries; a branch projects the variables out after `Acquire` and reassembles
  them before `Release`, and `INIT_LOCKS` in the process function is the only place an initial
  value is ever written. This is why `Network2Go.Locks` does not prune thread-confined locks.

  Four choices are this compiler's own:

  - **Names.** A readable scheduler name like `SndPi`, or a process function called `Pong`, collides
    with what a user-written definition of the same name compiles to — and `PingPongs.tla` really
    does have a process `Ping` beside a `CONSTANT Ping`. The synthesized names go through
    `Naming`'s `blockName`/`branchName`/`threadName`/`processName` instead.
  - **Assignment through a reference.** Compiling `r ≔ e` index by index would assume a TLA⁺
    function is a Go map. Here it is a `LazyFunction`, and a
    sequence is 1-indexed, so `x[i] := e` compiles the way `[x EXCEPT ![i] = e]` does — through
    `compileExcept`, which already knows all three cases (function, sequence, tuple).
  - **`LOCK`/`UNLOCK`** are `locks.Acquire`/`locks.Release` calls, not raw channel operations, so
    that `Lock[τ] = chan τ` stays inside the runtime library.
  - **`multicast`** compiles to a single `comm.Multicast` call. The iteration lives in the runtime
    library rather than in emitted code: the
    specification fixes no order on the sends, so there is nothing for a generated loop to say
    that the library cannot. The payload becomes a function literal from the recipient, which is
    why `ProcEnv` carries the channels' element types — Go infers a literal's parameter types
    from nothing, and demands its result type outright.

/--
  Everything the compilation of one process's blocks needs to agree on: the names its generated
  functions bind, and the lock assignment they all share.

  `self` is *not* freshly named. A compiled expression mentioning `self` goes through
  `binderName`, so the parameter has to answer to exactly that; the elaborator binds `self` rather
  than declaring it, so no process-local variable can collide with it. `net` and `done` are
  fresh, since nothing in a compiled expression refers to them and a process variable named `net`
  is perfectly legal.

/-- A branch's guards. `await` conjoins onto `guard` unconditionally — its condition is always
total, an ordinary TLA⁺ boolean, so evaluating it after `guard` has already gone `false` costs
nothing but a redundant read. `with x = e` is not total: `e` can be a `CHOOSE`/search with no
witness, undefined exactly when some guard textually before it already made the branch not fire.
So only `e`'s own evaluation is gated, by the *current* `guard` at that point — `var x τ` (no
initializer, nothing to evaluate) sits outside the `if`, the assignment inside it. Nothing else in
the branch needs to nest: `guard` only ever narrows (`&&`), never recovers, so a later statement
reading `guard` — the next `with`'s own `if`, another `await`, or the branch's final `if guard {
action }` — sees the same false once anything upstream has failed, whether or not this `with`
actually ran. (A later `with`'s `e` may then read `x` at its zero value rather than a real one,
if `guard` was already `false` here — harmless, since that later `with` is itself gated on the
same `guard` and so skips its own assignment too, never forcing the zero value through anything
partial.) One `if` per `with`, each independent — not one nested inside the last. -/

always `0`); the thesis emits it anyway and so does this, leaving the peephole to a later pass
rather than special-casing the shape here.

The `ToInt` around the switch head is load-bearing rather than cosmetic. `Rand` is typed over the
runtime's `Int`, which under the default arbitrary-precision build is a struct — an `Int`-valued
switch head could not match the integer-literal cases, and Go would reject the function. -/

  Which non-`@parameter` variables need a Go local, in declaration order.

  Not all of them, and the answer is not "the ones in some lock" either. Lock inference narrows
  every footprint to the process's declared variables (`Network2Go/Locks.lean`), so a variable no
  branch touches lands in no lock, and a lock *is* a variable's storage — such a variable is
  emitted nowhere at all, and emitting a local for it anyway would be an unused local, which Go
  rejects.

  But a variable in no lock can still be *read*: by a later initializer (`variables x = 1, y = x
  + 1`, where only `y` is ever touched) or by a later `@parameter`'s bound (`variables limit = 10,
  @parameter start ∈ 1..limit`, where the assertion is `limit`'s only reader). Hence the backward
  pass — a variable is needed when it belongs to a lock, or when something later that *is* emitted
  names it. A `@parameter`'s bound always counts, since its assertion is always emitted; a
  dropped initializer's free variables do not.

  Scope makes one pass enough: an initializer may name only variables declared before it
  (`Elaborator/PlusCal.lean`'s `checkVariables` extends Γ per entry), so every read reaches
  backward and a right-to-left walk sees it before the declaration it refers to.

/--
  A process's initialization prologue: the declaration walk, then the initial lock values
  (`INIT_LOCKS`).

  **The walk is in declaration order, and interleaves two different things.** A `@parameter`
  emits no local — its value comes from the caller, as a parameter of the process function, so
  `binderName x` already names it — but its declared bound becomes an assertion. Every other
  variable emits a Go local: `Pick(S)` for an `∈` initializer, the compiled expression for `=`,
  and nothing for an uninitialized one, which leaves it at Go's zero value (the runtime types are
  built to accept theirs — `tlaplus.Int`'s reads as `0` rather than dereferencing a nil pointer).

  Interleaving rather than asserting everything up front is what lets a bound name an earlier
  local. Nothing forces the other order: a parameter is live from function entry, a local is
  computed from parameters and earlier locals, and an assertion computes nothing, so declaration
  order is both what PlusCal's sequential initializers already mean and the order that fires each
  assertion as early as it can — before an initializer that could panic on the very value the
  assertion is there to reject.

  **Locals come before locks because a lock is where the variable lives.** A process-local exists
  only inside its lock's struct, so an initializer naming an earlier sibling would otherwise
  compile to a Go identifier that does not exist; with the locals emitted first, each lock's
  struct is built by naming them.

/--
  A whole process: its threads' functions, and the function that starts them.

  The process function returns `done` immediately rather than blocking, so its caller decides when
  to wait. Each *code* thread signals the buffered `done'` when it reaches `goto Done`; a final
  goroutine reads `done'` once per code thread and only then signals the unbuffered `done`.
  Receiving threads never signal: they run until the medium vanishes, which is not the process
  finishing.

  `mailbox` is a parameter, not something the generated code constructs. The compiler emits no
  `main` and takes no position on how processes find each other — whoever assembles the system
  supplies a `Receiver` backed by a socket, a queue, or a Go channel.
