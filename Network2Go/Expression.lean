  Compiling TLA⁺ expressions into Go expressions.

  The output is a single `Go.Expression`, never a statement prelude: everything that needs
  statements to express — the quantifiers' search loops, `IF`/`CASE`'s laziness, `EXCEPT`'s record
  update — is wrapped in an immediately-applied `Go.Expression.funcLit`. That keeps this function
  callable from any expression position (a branch's guard, an argument, another expression's
  sub-term) without every caller having to thread a list of statements to emit first. `funcLit`
  exists in `Core.Go.Syntax` precisely because these forms cannot be compiled without it.

  Recurring conventions, all forced by the runtime library's own types:

  - **Everything of TLA⁺ type `Bool` is `tlaplus.Bool`, not Go's `bool`.** `Bool` is a defined type
    over `bool`, so Go's own `&&`/`||`/`!` still apply to it directly and their results stay
    `tlaplus.Bool`; what does *not* apply is using one as an `if` condition or handing one to a
    runtime predicate, both of which want a real `bool`. Those sites convert with `bool(e)`, and
    anything producing a Go `bool` (`SetIn`, `Eq`, `SetEq`) converts back with `tlaplus.Bool(e)`.
  - **Literals go through the constructors, never composite literals.** `tlaplus.MkInt(1)` rather
    than `Int(1)` (the arbitrary-precision representation is a struct), `MkSet`/`MkSeq` rather than
    `Set[τ]{…}`/`Seq[τ]{…}` (a set literal may be unsorted or repeat an element; a sequence is
    1-indexed with slot 0 unused). The one exception is the *empty* literal, which has nothing to
    infer a type parameter from and so is written `tlaplus.Set[τ]{}` — trivially sorted,
    duplicate-free, and for `Seq` the nil slice is already the valid empty sequence.
  - **Types are read off the AST, never re-derived.** Go's `func` literals have mandatory
    signatures, so `{e : x ∈ S}`, `[x ∈ S ↦ e]`, `IF`/`CASE` and a record `EXCEPT` all have to write
    out a type TLA⁺ never spells. The checker records each of them
    (`Elaborator/Expressions.lean`); this pass only reads them off the node it is compiling.
    `f[e]`'s head type is recorded for a different reason — it is a three-way dispatch, between a
    function application, a sequence index and a tuple projection, not a type to emit.
  - **Operator applications dispatch on the head's `Origin`.** `\in`, `=` and friends are not Go
    functions with those names — `x \in S` reverses its arguments into `SetIn(o, S, x)` and `=`
    picks between the element dictionary's `Eq`, `SetEq` and `SeqEq` by operand type — so a builtin
    head is matched at the application site rather than compiled to a name and applied. A *bare*
    builtin reference (one passed around rather than applied) has no Go counterpart at all and is
    rejected.
  - **Every comparison is a dictionary call, and the dictionary comes from the type.** `Ord[T]` is
    a struct of two functions, not an interface, so nothing is a method on the value being
    compared: `x = y` at type `τ` is `⟦τ⟧ᴼʳᵈ.Eq(x, y)`, and every runtime operation that compares
    (`MkSet`, `SetIn`, `SetUnion`, `FnApply`, …) takes the dictionary as its first argument. Which
    dictionary a `Set` was built with is not recorded in the set, so every operation on it must be
    handed the same one — guaranteed here by deriving both from the same `Typ`, via `ordDict`. The
    operations that never compare (`SetFilter`, `Choose`, `Cardinality`, and all of `Sequences`
    except equality) take none.

  Deliberately not handled here, since they are not expression forms: operator and function
  *definitions* (including `MkRecFn` for recursive ones), which live in `Network2Go.Definition`,
  and the renaming of user-chosen names that collide after
  capitalization.

/-- The standard modules `Driver/Builtins.lean` supplies. A `.var`'s `Origin` records the module it
resolved in, and every one of these is compiled to a runtime call rather than to a reference to a
generated definition. Matching on the module *name* is sound because `Driver/Modules.lean` refuses
to silently shadow a builtin with a user module of the same name (it reports the ambiguity), so a

Cancels against `tlaBool` rather than nesting inside it. The two meet constantly — every runtime
predicate answers in Go's `bool`, gets wrapped so that the TLA⁺ expression has a TLA⁺ type, and is
then unwrapped again by whatever consumes it as a condition — and `bool(tlaplus.Bool(e))` is
merely `e`, so a compiled guard reads as one comparison instead of three nested calls. -/

  override stays scoped to the overloaded copy. Records and tuples have no such helper — Go has no
