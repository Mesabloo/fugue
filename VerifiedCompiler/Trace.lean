## Composing relations

Two ways of combining relations, both used to say how the `Trace` class below builds a refinement's
trace relation out of its factors'. They are different monoid structures on relations and
should not be confused: `∘ᵣ`'s unit is the diagonal, `⊗ᵣ`'s is the relation holding only of the two
units.

Relations are heterogeneous throughout — a source and a target need not draw their traces from the
same type.

does (`Guarded2Network/Lemmas/Trace.lean`): its traces happen to agree exactly, since reception is
not an observable event, so it opts into the equality instance rather than needing a different one.

`Rτ` occurs only positively in a refinement (inside the existential in `Terminating`'s conclusion),
never as a hypothesis, so there is no degenerate instantiation to exclude and no reflexivity or

# Relating traces across languages

`Rτ` stays a relation between source and target traces, not a fixed equality, so a pass whose
traces genuinely diverge has somewhere to put that relation without changing this framework.
`Guarded2Network` does not need it: reception is not an observable event (`Behavior` is
`print | send`, the `.rx` thread is silent), so its traces agree exactly and it registers
`Rτ := Eq` (`Trace.instSeq`, `Guarded2Network/Lemmas/Trace.lean`). A relation relaxed to
happens-before consistency would in fact be *unsound* for reception, not merely unneeded: a source
block whose guard never holds can emit nothing while the target still consumes from a channel — the
mismatch is in the *multiset* of events, not their order, so no reordering relation relates the two
traces. Refinement is therefore stated against a *relation* between traces rather than equality,
with the source trace existentially quantified.

The relation is a parameter, not a fixed choice, and each composition lemma computes the relation
its conclusion carries: `Relation.rmul` (`⊗ᵣ`) when two executions are sequenced, since the traces
concatenate, and `Relation.Comp` (`∘ᵣ`) when a trace passes through an intermediate language. Only
the fixed-point lemmas constrain it, and there the constraint is what preservation of traces means
rather than a technical side condition.

`SCPrefix` is the aborting counterpart: relativized *prefix*, for a source that stopped early. It
is defined from the relation rather than being a second parameter, so that a composed refinement
still concludes something a reader can name.

the converse is `Rτ_one`, splitting a trace as `ε * 1`. Both laws are the class's, which is why this
is stated here and not at `MulClosed` — `Relation.MulClosed.rmul_le` alone cannot prove it.

This is what lets the composition lemmas conclude at `Rτ` rather than at the `⊗ᵣ`/`⊔` shape their
proofs naturally produce, so that composing two refinements needs no repair at the call site. -/

The three below are what a refinement algebra consumes in place of a prefix order's
`le_extend_mul`, `le_mul_right_inj` and `le_trans`. Only two hypotheses appear, both on the
relation itself and both holding of any relation that is reflexive and closed under
concatenation.
-/

/-- Sequencing, with the source aborting inside the *first* factor. The target still ran both and
emitted `b₁ * b₂`, so the tail `b₂` has to be matchable by something — which is exactly why the
second factor's relation must be left-total. -/

/-- The generic case: source and target traces of the same list type agree by plain equality — no
pass-specific relaxation. `Trace.SCPrefix Eq a b ↔ a <+: b` is `Iff.rfl` (`List.IsPrefix` unfolds to

`≼[Rτ]` is the ordinary prefix order, and this is the degenerate case of the generalization rather
than merely isomorphic to it.

Deliberately a `def`, not an `instance`: a pass whose alphabet needs a different `Rτ` for the same
list type registers its own, and an ambient `Trace (List α) (List α)` instance defaulting to `Eq`
would silently compete with it. Name this explicitly where the default is actually wanted — as
