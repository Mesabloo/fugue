/-!
  The denotational semantics of Guarded PlusCal, as three relations per syntactic form: `reducing`
  (a step to a successor state, emitting a list of observable behaviors), `aborting` (a state from
  which the form goes wrong), and `diverging` (a state from which it runs forever).

  They are plain definitions rather than `Reduce`/`Abort`/`Diverge` instances, so the
  `⟦·⟧*`/`⟦·⟧⊥`/`⟦·⟧∞` notations do not apply here. Those classes take their second argument as an
  `outParam`, and with the value type abstract it occurs *only* there — nothing in a `Statement` or
  an `AtomicBranch` mentions it — so Lean cannot order the synthesis of the `ExprSemantics`
  argument. Nothing needs the classes: `StrongRefinement` takes the relations as plain `Set`s. The
  instances can be registered later, against the concrete TLA⁺ value type.

  Blocking and aborting are deliberately different: a statement with no `reducing` transition and no
  `aborting` state is a guard that is simply not enabled yet, which is what `await`, `receive` on an
  empty FIFO, and `with x ∈ {}` all are. That distinction is why `ExprSemantics` exposes `isBool`
  and `isSet` — without them a non-boolean guard would be indistinguishable from a false one.

  The expression layer underneath is abstract (`ComputableTLAPlus.ExprSemantics`), to be refined to
  the real TLA⁺ semantics later; see that file's module doc.

  Channels are kept out of the main memory, in a separate `FIFOs` map, so a local state is a
  variable memory beside a channel memory. An expression that reaches into a channel therefore has no
  meaning at all here rather than a wrong one, which is what lets the expression layer stay ignorant
  of channels entirely.

  This file stops at `AtomicBranch`. Threads, processes and algorithms are above it: a thread has no
  denotation of its own, only the labels it owns, and the process and algorithm layers are defined by
  fixed points over a step relation. See `Core/NetworkPlusCal/Semantics/Denotational.lean`'s
  `Thread.labels`.

  Failure modes a well-formedness side condition could assume away are stated instead: a `receive`
  with a bad channel, an `await` on a non-boolean and a `with x ∈ e` on a non-set all abort here
  rather than blocking or being ruled out by assumption.

variable {V : Type u} [ExprSemantics V] (Ξ : OperatorEnv) (Ω : Model V)

/-- The key identifying a single FIFO: the channel's name together with its resolved index path.
Only the name and the evaluated indices are observable, and this is also the shape a
`Behavior.send` reports. -/
abbrev ChanKey (V : Type u) : Type u := String × List (PathStep V)

/-- The name a process instance's own identity is bound to, matching `Elaborator/PlusCal.lean`'s
`extend "self" .address`. -/
def selfName : String := "self"

/-- One of the possible observable behaviors exhibited by PlusCal statements. Every event carries the
process instance that emitted it — the value bound to `selfName` in its memory — so that program
order within one process is recoverable from a trace that interleaves several. Without it, two
`print`s from different processes would be indistinguishable from two `print`s of the same process,
and their relative order would stop being observable.

`send` additionally carries the channel it pushes onto.

**Reception is not an event.** The alphabet is exactly `print` and `send`, and a `recv` event would
be unsound as an observation of the source program: `Guarded2Network` defers consumption to a `.rx`
thread that pops the channel ahead of the block that uses the value, so a block whose guard never
holds — `l: receive(ch, x) ; await FALSE ; goto l'` — pops a message in the target while the source
block never reduces at all and so never emits anything. No relation up to reordering repairs that:
the target event has no source counterpart to be reordered against. What ties the channel's contents
to the target's `inbox` is the refinement invariant `relatesTo`, per channel. -/
inductive Behavior (V : Type u) : Type u
  | print (p v : V)
  | send (p : V) (c : ChanKey V) (v : V)

/-- The trace alphabet: a possibly-infinite sequence of observable events. `Monoid (Seq α)` makes it
the ordered monoid traces are composed in.

Possibly-infinite and not `List`, even though no statement or block can emit an infinite trace —
`Statement.diverging` is `∅` and a block is finite, so divergence enters only at `Algebra`
(`Semantics/Process.lean`). A diverging algorithm that keeps sending emits forever, and a `List`
cannot hold what it emits: with a finite trace type `Algebra.diverging` could only contain
executions that fall silent after finitely many events, so every productive divergence would be
absent from the denotation outright.

The type is uniform across the statement, block and algorithm layers rather than finite below and
infinite above, so no layer boundary carries a `Seq.ofList` coercion. Finiteness of the reducing and
aborting traces is a derived property rather than a typing constraint: nothing downstream needs it,
and no proof relies on cancellativity (`Seq` has none — an infinite left factor absorbs its right
factor, `mul_eq_left_of_not_terminates`). -/
abbrev Trace (V : Type u) : Type u := Stream'.Seq (Behavior V)

/-- The global map containing FIFOs. Pushes go on the right, pops come off the left.

`Finmap` for the reason `Memory` is one (`Core/ComputableTLAPlus/Semantics/Interface.lean`): key
order is not observable, and letting it into the type turns commutation lemmas false. Updating a
channel is `insert` rather than `AList.replace` — every rule below establishes `F.lookup k = some _`
before writing `k`, so the two agree wherever either is reached, and `insert` is the one with a
usable `lookup` equation (`= some v`, not `v <$ lookup k F`). -/
abbrev FIFOs (V : Type u) : Type u := Finmap λ _ : ChanKey V ↦ List V

/-- The local reduction state of an atomic block: the process's own memory, the channels, and a
label field that is `none` while running and `some l` once a terminal `goto` has jumped to `l`.
`Statement b b'` already tracks terminality syntactically and the reduction relations pin the
label field's value (`none` on every source state, `some _` only on a `goto`'s target), so nothing
is gained by also carrying it at the type level — see `Statement.reducing` below.

There is deliberately no third component for `with`-bound temporaries. That an assignment does not
target a block-local binder is a syntactic property, checked by `WellFormedness`; keeping it in the
state would oblige every lemma to translate between two state shapes for no proof-side gain. -/

/-! # Reduction of blocks

  Generic over the index family and the state type: a block reduces by composing its elements'
  relations left to right, and aborts (or diverges) if any prefix reduces to a state from which the
  next element does. Nothing here mentions values, so these definitions are reused verbatim for
  `NetworkPlusCal`.
-/

/-- A possibly-empty *list* of statements as a relation. The one recursion in this section: a block
is this fold over its `begin`, composed with its `last`, and every equation about a block is a list
equation underneath.

A `Block` is non-empty by construction while a pass can hand back an empty run of statements
(`Guarded2Network`'s consumption assignments, for a branch that receives nothing), so the list form
has to exist in its own right — and being homogeneous in the guard index, it cannot express a block's
possibly-terminal `last`. That is the whole difference between the two.
