/-!
  The expression layer that the PlusCal denotational semantics
  (`Core/GuardedPlusCal/Semantics/Denotational.lean` and its `NetworkPlusCal` counterpart) sits on
  top of, kept abstract.

  Statement semantics genuinely need to look inside values — `await`/`assert` compare against
  `TRUE`, `with x ∈ e` picks a member of a set, `assign`/`receive` write into a value along a
  reference's path, `receive` applies the coercion the elaborator recorded. None of that can be
  written against a bare `Value : Type`, so every such operation is a field of `ExprSemantics`
  rather than a definition over known constructors.

  Evaluation is a *relation*, not an `Option`-valued function: a user-defined operator call has to
  re-descend into that operator's body, jumping to an unrelated syntax tree with no measure Lean's
  termination checker can see. A relation needs only strict positivity, and an expression with no
  derivation tree is exactly an expression with no value — which is why `Aborts` below is derived
  from `Eval` rather than being a second parameter.

  `Eval` also takes an `OperatorEnv` (`Ξ`) and a `Model` (`Ω`), separate from `Memory` — see those
  types' own docs — to resolve a user-defined operator's name and a `CONSTANT`'s value; see `evalVar`
  for how the three environments interact.

  Refining this to the real TLA⁺ semantics means providing one `ExprSemantics` instance for a
  concrete value type; nothing downstream of this file changes.

universe u

/-- The operator environment: a static table from a declaring module's name and an operator name in
it to that operator's formal parameters (name paired with arity — `0` for a plain value parameter,
`n > 0` for an `n`-ary higher-order parameter) and its defining body expression. Mirrors
`Declaration.operator`'s own `List (String × Nat) → Expression α` shape, since `Ξ` is populated from
exactly those declarations, one module at a time.

Keyed by module name because `Origin.module name` — the tag a `.var` node referring to an operator
carries, whether the operator lives in the same module or was reached through `EXTENDS` — already
names the module to look in; `evalVar` below consults `Ξ` only for that origin, so a name can never
be ambiguous between two modules'. A `CONSTANT` declaration is not in `Ξ` — it has no defining body —
see `Model` below for how a `CONSTANT`'s `.var` node gets its value instead.

Not indexed by `V`: unlike `Memory`, an unevaluated operator body is a piece of syntax, not a value,
so `Ξ` needs no value type to be well-formed. Kept a plain function rather than a `Finmap` — nothing
in this file's laws ever needs to enumerate or compare two `Ξ`s, only look one name up. -/
abbrev OperatorEnv : Type := String → String → Option (List (String × Nat) × Expression Typ)

/-- Every operator body in `Ξ` is closed: it reads nothing from memory. `evalLocal`/`evalSubst`
need this — a `var_op0`/`opCall_op` step evaluates a body (or its `substParams` form) that is not a
subterm of the call, so agreement on the call's free variables says nothing about that body unless
the body is closed. Populated `Ξ`s satisfy it by construction: an operator definition's body is
checked against a scope holding exactly its parameters (`Origin.bound`) plus module-level names
(`Origin.module`), and `freeVars` counts neither — only `Origin.free`, which a body never has. -/
def OperatorEnv.WellScoped (Ξ : OperatorEnv) : Prop :=
  ∀ m x params body, Ξ m x = some (params, body) → body.freeVars = ∅

/-- `c`'s synthesized binder names avoid `S` — and, through the nested `{x}`/`insert y S`
recursions, each other. The freshness side condition `evalCoerce` needs: `Coercion.applyComputable`
for `.seqToFun` and `.function` wraps the coerced expression `e` in a binder `c` introduces and
re-evaluates `e` underneath it, so unless that binder is fresh for `e` the built term captures and
the law is false. `S` is instantiated to `e.freeVars` at the law; a real compilation discharges it
because every coercion binder is `MonadFresh`-minted and `e`'s names are not.

Only `.seqToFun`/`.function` place `e` under a binder — the other cases keep it in domain or
argument position, so their arms impose nothing on `S` directly and only recurse. `.set`/inner
`.function` recurse against `{x}` rather than `S` because there the sub-expression is the bare
binder node `.var x _ .binder`, not something built over `e`. `.function` also keeps its value
binder `y` off `x`: `applyComputable`'s recovered-argument `CHOOSE` reuses `x`, and the built
`x = y` comparison is only correct when the two are distinct. -/

/-- The model: an assignment of a value to every `CONSTANT` a run fixes one for, keyed the same way
`Ξ` is (declaring module, then name) since a `CONSTANT`'s `.var` node carries the same `Origin.module`
tag an operator reference does. Kept opaque and partial rather than computed: a `CONSTANT` has no
defining expression to evaluate (`Declaration.constants` carries only a name and a type), so its
value can only ever come from outside — one run's choice of `Model`, not this file's laws. A name
with no entry has no value under `Eval`, same as any other partiality in this class. -/
abbrev Model (V : Type u) : Type u := String → String → Option V

/-- A memory: a partial map from names to values.

`Finmap`, not `AList`. An `AList` is a list, so its identity includes the *order* its keys were
inserted in — and `evalLocal` says evaluation depends on a memory only through `lookup`, so that
order is information the semantics provably cannot observe. Keeping it visible makes false goals:
binding two distinct names in the two possible orders gives equal lookups but unequal `AList`s, and
any lemma commuting one write past another (`Guarded2Network/Lemmas/Reorder.lean`) then cannot be
stated as an equation at all. `Finmap` is that quotient, so `Finmap.insert_insert_of_ne` holds and
extensionality is by `lookup`. `FIFOs` is a `Finmap` for the same reason. -/
abbrev Memory (V : Type u) : Type u := Finmap λ _ : String ↦ V

/-- One resolved segment of a reference's access path. Mirrors `ElaboratedPlusCal.Ref.args`'s
`List (String ⊕ ε)` with the index expressions already evaluated: `.inl f` is the record field `f`,
`.inr v` is the index `v`. -/
abbrev PathStep (V : Type u) : Type u := String ⊕ V

/-- `ResolvesPath Eval M path resolved` — every `.inr` index expression in the syntactic path
`path` evaluates (under `Eval`/`M`) to the matching entry of the semantic path `resolved`; every
`.inl` field segment carries over unchanged. What `evalExcept` needs to relate `Expression.except`'s
syntactic update path to `updatePath`'s semantic one. Takes `Eval` as a plain parameter rather than
an `ExprSemantics` instance so it can be stated *before* the class whose field it appears in. -/

  [decEq : DecidableEq V]
  /-- `Eval Ξ Ω M e v` — under operator environment `Ξ`, model `Ω`, and memory `M`, expression `e`

  /-- `mem v S` — `v` is a member of the set value `S`. -/
  mem : V → V → Prop
  /-- `updatePath old path v` — `old` with the position named by `path` overwritten by `v`, or
  `none` when `path` does not resolve inside `old`. `path = []` overwrites `old` outright. -/
  updatePath : V → List (PathStep V) → V → Option V
  /-- The empty path overwrites the old value outright, and always succeeds. A law rather than only
  a remark on `updatePath` above, because `Memory.update` routes an *unindexed* assignment (`x := e`,
  where the reference has no `.args`) through `updatePath` too: without this, the memory such an
  assignment produces is not pinned to `M.insert x v`, and no reorder lemma can identify it with the
  memory substitution describes. -/
  updatePath_nil {old v : V} : updatePath old [] v = some v
  /-- `seqAppend s v` — `s` with `v` appended on the right, `none` when `s` is not a sequence value.
  TLA⁺'s `Append(s, v)`. Needed by `NetworkPlusCal.Thread.rx`, which drains a channel into a
  process-local sequence. -/
  seqAppend : V → V → Option V
  /-- `isSeq s vs` — `s` is the sequence value whose elements are `vs`, in order. The link between
  the value world and a `List V`: a sequence-valued local and a FIFO's contents are otherwise two
  unrelated things, and nothing else in this class bridges them.

  A relation rather than a partial function to a list, for the same reason `Eval` is one: it is a
  fact about a value, not a computation, and a value that is not a sequence is simply related to
  no list. Kept element-level (no `isSeq`-vs-`seqAppend` well-formedness field): `seqAppend_isSeq`
  below is the only interaction the semantics needs. -/
  isSeq : V → List V → Prop
  /-- A value is the sequence of at most one element list. -/
  isSeq_inj {s : V} {vs ws : List V} : isSeq s vs → isSeq s ws → vs = ws
  /-- The empty sequence literal has a value, and it is the empty sequence. The one place a *value*
  has to be known to be a sequence from the syntax that produced it rather than from an operation on
  another sequence: `seqAppend` covers every step after the first, and this covers the first.

  Stated as existence for the reason `seqAppend_isSeq` is: *totality* is then part of the law. An
  initial state exists only if every declared initializer evaluates, so an implication would leave a
  `<<>>` initializer free to have no value at all. The implication form is `isSeq_of_eval_seq_nil`
  below, `evalUnique` away. -/
  eval_seq_nil {Ξ : OperatorEnv} {Ω : Model V} {M : Memory V} {τ : Typ} :
    ∃ s, Eval Ξ Ω M (.seq [] τ) s ∧ isSeq s []
  /-- Appending to a sequence value always succeeds, and appends to its element list. Stated as
  existence rather than as an equation on a given result so that `seqAppend`'s *totality on
  sequences* is part of the law — `Thread.rxBranch` treats a failed append as an abort, which must
  not be reachable when `inbox` really holds a sequence. -/
  seqAppend_isSeq {s v : V} {vs : List V} : isSeq s vs →
    ∃ s', seqAppend s v = some s' ∧ isSeq s' (vs ++ [v])
  /-- Every tail of a sequence is itself a sequence value. The counterpart of `seqAppend_isSeq` on
  the other side: that one says the value world is closed under adding an element, this one that it
  is closed under dropping the first. Needed because `isSeq` is a relation — without it a list could
  have no value representing it, and a compiled `inbox := Tail(inbox)` would be free to abort where
  the source it compiles does not. -/
  isSeq_tail {s v : V} {vs : List V} : isSeq s (v :: vs) → ∃ t, isSeq t vs
  /-- `coerce c v v'` — applying the coercion `c` to `v` yields `v'`. The value-level counterpart of
  `Coercion.apply`/`Coercion.applyComputable`, which act on expressions. -/
  coerce : TypedTLAPlus.Coercion → V → V → Prop
  /-- An expression has at most one value. `Eval` is a relation because evaluation may *fail* to
  have a derivation, not because a TLA⁺ expression could denote two things — non-determinism enters
  the PlusCal semantics through `with x ∈ S` and process scheduling, never through an expression.

  Load-bearing rather than cosmetic: a `Ref`'s index path resolves through `EvalStep`, so without
  this a channel reference could resolve to two different `ChanKey`s at once and no invariant could
  name *the* FIFO a `receive` reads. `EvalStep.path_inj` is that consequence. -/
  evalUnique {Ξ : OperatorEnv} {Ω : Model V} {M : Memory V} {e : Expression Typ} {v w : V} :
    Eval Ξ Ω M e v → Eval Ξ Ω M e w → v = w
  /-- A variable node's meaning is dispatched on its `Origin`, each case denoting from exactly one of
  the three environments:
  - `.free name` — the name is `Memory`-keyed (a PlusCal variable, `self`, a statement `with`):
    `M.lookup name`.
  - `.bound _` — a de Bruijn index. `Eval` only ever meets a binder body after it has been opened
    with a name, so a bare `.bound` node denotes nothing — `False`.
  - `.intrinsic _` — a hardcoded builtin (`=`, `/\`, `DOMAIN`, …) has no value on its own; it only
    means something as the head of an `opCall`, which a concrete `ExprSemantics` instance dispatches
    off the builtin table directly. Bare, it denotes nothing — hence `False`, not a memory lookup.
  - `.module m name` — `Naturals`'s `Nat`/`Integers`'s `Int` denote their integer-set families; every
    other name is looked up in `Ξ`'s entry for `m` (0-arity operator body, or `Ω m name` for a
    `CONSTANT`). Not covered here — no abstract consumer reads a `.module` node this way.

  Scoped to `.free`: `Origin` alone selects the case, and this is the only one every abstract
  consumer needs (all `evalVar` uses are on `Memory`-keyed names). -/
  evalVar {Ξ : OperatorEnv} {Ω : Model V} {M : Memory V} {τ : Typ} {name : String} {v : V} :
    Eval Ξ Ω M (.var τ (.free name)) v ↔ M.lookup name = some v
  /-- Applying a coercion to an expression denotes the coercion applied to that expression's value.
  `TypedTLAPlus.Coercion.applyComputable` and `coerce` above are the expression-level and
  value-level views of one operation, and this is the only thing connecting them — a pass that
  compiles a coercion into synthesized syntax (`Guarded2Network` does, on a `receive`'s consumption
  assignment) can relate the two only through this law.

  An `↔`: the forward reading turns the target's evaluated right-hand side into the source's
  `coerce` obligation, the backward one builds the target's from the source's.

  Needs `Ξ.WellScoped` for the same reason `evalLocal` does: `applyComputable` for
  `.seqToFun`/`.function` re-evaluates `e` under a binder the coercion introduces, and relating
  that to `e`'s value in the ambient memory is exactly `evalLocal`. The binder is opened at a name
  chosen fresh for `e` (locally-nameless, cofinite `Eval` rules), so the `Coercion.FreshFor c
  e.freeVars` argument is no longer load-bearing — kept only until its callers are cleaned up. -/

  through `Ξ`, and that body is not part of `e`, so its own free variables have to be confined to
  the operator's parameters for the call's `freeVars` to bound what memory the call depends on. -/

/-- An update and a binding of some *other* name commute: updating first and then binding `x`
reaches the same memory as binding `x` first and then updating, and either order succeeds exactly
when the other does. `Memory` being a `Finmap` is what makes this an equation rather than only a
`lookup`-wise agreement — see that abbreviation's doc. Both readings are used, one per direction of
`Guarded2Network/Lemmas/Reorder.lean`'s `with` case, where the binding is the `with`'s own. -/

/-- `evalSubst` lifted from a name to a *reference*: evaluating in the memory an assignment produced
agrees with evaluating the reference-substituted expression in the memory it started from. This is
the transfer the reorder lemmas run on (`Guarded2Network/Lemmas/Reorder.lean`), and it is derived —
`evalSubst` covers a bare reference directly, while a compound one needs `evalVar` to name the value
being updated and `evalExcept` to say the synthesized `EXCEPT` denotes exactly the `updatePath` the
assignment ran.

`r`'s target is a declared PlusCal variable, `Origin.binder`, so `evalVar`'s `.module`-lookup branch
never applies to it — `evalVar.mpr hold` below goes through unconditionally, no side condition
needed (see `evalVar`'s own doc for why `Origin` alone, not a name-shadowing assumption, decides
this). -/
