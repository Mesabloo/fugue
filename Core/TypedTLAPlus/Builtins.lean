/-!
  The single shared table of builtin operators — every name `builtinContext`
  (`Elaborator/Declarations.lean`) and `builtinModules` (`Driver/Builtins.lean`) bind, plus the
  coercion-only `StrToSeq` neither binds, keyed by `(Origin, name)`. Pure data with no
  `Driver`/`Elaborator` dependency, so any pass downstream of type checking can recognize a builtin
  call without re-deriving its own string list.

  This is the one place the name↔operator wiring is written down: the reserved-temporal-action
  check and `Typed2Computable`'s "is this builtin computable?" question both read it from here.

  One constructor per literal builtin rather than a lighter category-tagged table: gives
  exhaustiveness-checked `match`es to every downstream consumer, at the cost of hand-duplicating
  each name a third time here.

/-- One constructor per name `builtinContext`/`builtinModules` bind. Naming mirrors each
operator's own TLA⁺ role, not its surface spelling (`eq` for `=`, `cup` for `\cup`, …) — see
`builtinOpOf?` for the spelling↔constructor table itself. -/

outright by bare name in `WellFormedness/Restrictions.lean`'s check 3 regardless of whether the

origin-agnostic check is exact). `^+`/`^*`/`^#`/`~>`/`-+->` have no typing rule and so no
`BuiltinOp` constructor above — genuinely unbound, unlike the other five, which double as real
`builtinOpOf?` entries (`.enabled`, `.unchanged`, `.always`, `.eventually`, `.prime`). Kept as a
separate list rather than derived from `builtinOpOf?`, since the two overlap but aren't the same. -/
